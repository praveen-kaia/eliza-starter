The content of the original \n\n### communique has been repurposed for sharing with the community. We as an \n\n### organization chose to do this to provide the broader Kaia community with insights \n\n### and visibility into how the Kaia works as an organization. \n\nOpen in app Sign up Sign in \n\n Search Write \n\n## Sign up to discover human stories that deepen your understanding of \n\n## the world. \n\n#### Free \n\n Distraction-free reading.

As we bid farewell to the wild ride that \n\n### was 2024, I wanted to take this opportunity to reflect on the past year and \n\n### share some thoughts as we move forward into the new year. \n\n## Reflecting on 2024 \n\n### 1. Project Dragon and Kaia \n\n### 2024 was defined by the chain integration that led to Kaia’s creation. Initiated \n\n### through Project Dragon, this integration brought immense hope and \n\n### challenges for Kaia and its members. While the process was complex, time\n\n### consuming, and demanding, it stands as one of our greatest achievements \n\n### this year. I believe this milestone has left a significant mark not only in Asia \n\n### but across the global blockchain industry. \n\n### Beyond integrating two chains, we also unified ecosystems and \n\n### organizations. This process elevated Kaia both technically and in governance \n\n### while creating a more developerand user-friendly environment by \n\n### integrating powerful infrastructure such as Pyth, FlipsideCrypto, Dune, The \n\n### Graph, Stargate. \n\n### 2. DeFi Revitalization \n\n### Blockchain’s success hinges on how much digital assets grow and are utilized \n\n### within its ecosystem. DeFi plays a critical role in this regard. However, both \n\n### Klaytn and Finschia struggled to achieve substantial growth in DeFi due to \n\n### limited diversification of participants and insufficient assets for utilization. \n\n### To address this, we launched the Dragon DeFi Initiative (D2I). By onboarding \n\n### diverse DEXs like Dragonswap, Capybara, and Kaiaswap alongside lending \n\n### protocols like Avalon, we have fostered competition and coexistence among \n\n### DEXs while driving TVL (Total Value Locked) growth. Additionally, the \n\n### foundation developed and operated Kaia Portal to activate various DeFi \n\n## Sign up to discover human stories that deepen your understanding of \n\n## the world. \n\n#### Free \n\n Distraction-free reading.

These efforts laid a solid \n\n### foundation for further activation of DeFi in 2025. \n\n### 3. Kaia Wave \n\n### Kaia Wave emerged as a key initiative in collaboration with LINE NEXT \n\n### during the latter half of 2024, and will remain a core focus through 2025. By \n\n### providing a Mini Dapp environment within LINE Messenger, we aim to \n\n### foster the growth of a Mini Dapp ecosystem that will increase users and \n\n### assets on Kaia while driving revenue growth for the chain. \n\n### Over 700 projects have applied to participate in Kaia Wave so far. Following a \n\n### rigorous selection process, many projects are set to launch in late January \n\n### and in Q1 of 2025. We are excited to bring to life one of Asia’s first consumer\n\n### focused Web3 ecosystems. \n\n## Looking Ahead to 2025 \n\n### 2025 will be a pivotal year for Kaia’s growth, centered around Kaia Wave. Our \n\n### focus will be on supporting Mini Dapp builders to bring engaging, fun, and \n\n### useful Web3 games and services to LINE Messenger users across Asia. \n\n### Here’s a glimpse of what you can look forward to in 2025: \n\n### An expansion of Kaia Wave, riding on the success of the inaugural batch \n\n### of Mini Dapps. \n\n### Kaia Portal will continue to play an important role in connecting users \n\n### and Dapps. \n\n### Exciting new developments and initiatives brought about by Consensus \n\n### Liquidity and the Kaia Community Committee, which were both \n\n### launched in late 2024. \n\n### Expect an expansion of the Galactica RWA initiative, beginning with the \n\n### launch of its tokenized product in early 2025. \n\n## Sign up to discover human stories that deepen your understanding of \n\n## the world. \n\n#### Free \n\n Distraction-free reading.

In order to ride this \n\n### wave and grow into a global blockchain network, the DeFi ecosystem, which \n\n### serves as the network’s infrastructure, must be in place. \n\n### In the real world, economic activities occurred first based on social \n\n### infrastructure such as national infrastructure, and natural infrastructure \n\n### such as the natural environment. Only then was financial infrastructure \n\n### created to provide capital borrowing to maximize the impact of economic \n\n### activities, serving as a catalyst for economic growth. \n\n### However, based on the precedents so far, we can see that this order of \n\n### development does not apply in the blockchain world.

    "# Dive into Kaia \n\n#### Kaia Foundation · Follow \n\n Published in Kaia · 6 min read · Jul 16, 2024 \n\n### With the impending launch of Kaia, the merged mainnet of the Finschia \n\n### Foundation and the Klaytn Foundation, the blockchain industry eagerly \n\n### anticipates the innovative features and changes it will introduce. In this \n\n### interview, we gain insights from Aidan, the current mainnet development \n\n### lead at the Klaytn Foundation. Since joining the Klaytn project in March \n\n### 2019, Aidan has played a pivotal role in the development of the Klaytn Square \n\n### and the Klip key management system. Now, he spearheads not only the \n\n### mainnet development for Kaia but also the advancement of Kaia Square and \n\n### Kaia Portal, ensuring seamless integration across business, marketing, and \n\n### governance domains. \n\nOpen in app Sign up Sign in \n\n Search Write \n\n## Sign up to discover human stories that deepen your understanding of \n\n## the world. \n\n#### Free \n\n Distraction-free reading.

We have meticulously planned to minimize the impact \n\n### on each ecosystem’s services. Klaytn has been publicly operational for over \n\n### five years, onboarding numerous partners independently. Conversely, \n\n### Finschia, while having fewer anonymous projects, boasts stronger ties with \n\n### its partners, facilitating direct communication. To streamline the process, \n\n### we decided to migrate projects that are easy to communicate with to the \n\n### Ethereum Virtual Machine (EVM) as it is the quickest method with minimal \n\n### ecosystem disruption. \n\n### Adopting EVM was the optimal choice since its specifications cover over 50% \n\n### of the global blockchain environment, enabling us to onboard more services \n\n### with the launch of the Kaia mainnet. Utilizing EVM for its accessibility \n\n### allows us to quickly activate Kaia’s initial ecosystem and subsequently \n\n### leverage Finschia’s exceptional features. This approach ensures a faster \n\n### integration while minimizing direct impacts on the ecosystem. \n\n### It is crucial to understand that the chain merge signifies the beginning of \n\n### Kaia, not its culmination. Beyond uniting Finschia and Klaytn, we are \n\n### defining Kaia’s distinct identity. As the merge progresses, we will share more \n\n### details about Kaia’s future direction and the innovative steps we are taking. \n\n## Was there an option to merge based on Cosmos? \n\n### The community suggested that, given Cosmos’s previous integration with \n\n### EVM, we might consider building on Cosmos. However, re-implementing \n\n### Klaytn’s functionalities and performance enhancements on Cosmos would \n\n### have been excessively time-consuming. Abandoning compatibility with the \n\n### existing Klaytn ecosystem would have resulted in significant technical and \n\n## Sign up to discover human stories that deepen your understanding of \n\n## the world. \n\n#### Free \n\n Distraction-free reading.

To expedite integration, we opted for a \n\n### method that minimized complexity and facilitated smoother transitions. \n\n## What challenges did you encounter during the development \n\n## process? \n\n### Time was our primary constraint. Following the approval of the merge \n\n### proposal in February, we had roughly three months to complete the \n\n### development. We faced differences in understanding and context between \n\n### the Finschia and Klaytn developers. Cultural and communication variances \n\n### further complicated matters, as we had to rapidly develop together without \n\n### much time to acclimate. \n\n### Setting new and ambitious goals beyond mere technical integration was also \n\n### crucial. Despite both teams’ extensive mainnet development experience, our \n\n### approaches to new challenges varied. Fortunately, continuous \n\n### communication and coordination have resolved many issues, and we are \n\n### now progressing in a unified direction. \n\n## Kaia Chain is known for prioritizing security. How do you ensure \n\n## this? \n\n### Security is a paramount concern for us. Over half of Klaytn’s mainnet \n\n### developers hold advanced degrees in security, underscoring our sensitivity \n\n### to potential threats. We conduct comprehensive tests, including \n\n### synchronization tests that verify the correct processing of all past blocks \n\n### with new versions, and these results are shared publicly on Github. \n\n### Additionally, we integrate the experience of Finschia developers and their \n\n### robust security development framework to enhance our systematic \n\n### approach. \n\n### Blockchain development is inherently complex and demands meticulous \n\n### attention, as errors can have irreversible consequences. To minimize risks, \n\n### we actively engage in peer reviews and operate a bug bounty program. \n\n## What do you focus on during testing? \n\n## Sign up to discover human stories that deepen your understanding of \n\n## the world. \n\n#### Free \n\n Distraction-free reading.

Both Finschia and Klaytn maintain a \n\n### relatively closed validator structure compared to public networks like \n\n### Ethereum, allowing for swift issue resolution. If a problem arises, the \n\n### foundation can quickly assess the situation and communicate with \n\n### validators, ensuring a rapid and responsible response. This operational \n\n### approach enables reliable and low-latency performance in real-world \n\n### environments. \n\n### Klaytn has operated the Baobab testnet alongside the mainnet from the \n\n### beginning, allowing us to identify and address potential issues in an \n\n### environment identical to the mainnet. While maintaining two chains \n\n### increases size and energy consumption, Baobab’s value in predicting and \n\n### mitigating future problems is immense. Now, as Baobab transitions to Kaia’s \n\n### testnet, Kairos, we anticipate it will play an even larger role. \n\n## What are Kaia’s strengths and differentiators compared to other \n\n## blockchains? \n\n### Kaia boasts the shortest latency from transaction creation to confirmation, \n\n### ensuring unmatched reliability. While some chains claim shorter block \n\n### times, actual usage often reveals inconsistencies. In contrast, Kaia has \n\n### consistently demonstrated 2-second transaction confirmations on the \n\n### mainnet, outperforming well-known chains in both speed and stability. \n\n## What about TPS (Transactions Per Second)? \n\n### Kaia inherits the 4,000 TPS capability from Klaytn, which was ranked 5th by \n\n### Chainspect’s Max Recorded TPS. Many chains often tout ideal TPS figures, \n\n### but Klaytn’s results come from real-world conditions. Under ideal \n\n### circumstances, Klaytn could have achieved tens of thousands of TPS, \n\n### indicating that Kaia can maintain top-level global performance. \n\n## Which categories of services are best suited for Kaia’s business \n\n## potential? \n\n## Sign up to discover human stories that deepen your understanding of \n\n## the world. \n\n#### Free \n\n Distraction-free reading.

Inspired \n\n### by the success of TON, we aim to integrate with messengers first, leveraging \n\n### their role as super apps. Unlike anonymous-focused platforms, our \n\n### messenger apps offer expansive service integration opportunities. \n\n### Technically, we plan to include Discord and Telegram, aiming for broad \n\n### blockchain integration through messengers as intermediaries. Though \n\n### regulatory and social challenges exist, we intend to overcome these step-by\n\n### step, showcasing Kaia’s strengths and differentiation to Web2 companies. \n\n### Ultimately, Kaia aims to expand into a super app, bridging blockchain with \n\n### various Web2 services. \n\n## How is technical development going to make the project stand \n\n## out among other blockchain networks? \n\n### Though still in the early stages, we are exploring new layers of development. \n\n### Rather than building blockchain applications within nodes, we’re \n\n### considering lightweight, plugin-like development to reduce the burden on \n\n### developers. This approach would simplify blockchain integration and allow \n\n### for the shared use of developed outcomes, akin to using SaaS services. \n\n### For users, receiving KAIA tokens could trigger simple plugin registrations for \n\n### notifications, while service providers could offer KAIA tokens as rewards \n\n### without requiring coding, using reusable modules. This user-friendly \n\n### approach will enable easy blockchain integration, even for those unfamiliar \n\n### with the technology, facilitating direct implementation within messengers or \n\n### related services. \n\n## What support plans are in place for the smooth onboarding of \n\n## dApp developers to the Kaia ecosystem? \n\n### Launching services on the Kaia network involves code audits, endpoint \n\n### utilization, and cloud server costs. We have secured key partners and operate \n\n### the IOK program to provide better prices and conditions. \n\n## Sign up to discover human stories that deepen your understanding of \n\n## the world. \n\n#### Free \n\n Distraction-free reading.

The core element of DeFi is liquidity provision, and we plan to \n\n### offer data platforms to showcase service performance. To foster a \n\n### comprehensive DeFi ecosystem, we are preparing for the seamless \n\n### integration of bridges, oracles, and other components. \n\n### We also aim to nurture projects in underrepresented sectors, focusing on \n\n### sustainable support like liquidity provision or platform integration, rather \n\n### than one-time grants that could pressure KAIA holders. Additionally, we are \n\n### organizing hackathons and acceleration programs to further support \n\n### development within the ecosystem. \n\n## What are the success metrics for the Kaia chain? \n\n### Well, defining success metrics is challenging. While transaction volume, \n\n### active users, token inflation, and the stability of tokenomics are important, \n\n### market capitalization is the ultimate indicator. Market cap is increasingly \n\n### crucial due to the interest of institutional investors. In Singapore, for \n\n### example, traditional financial institutions tend to include substantial tokens \n\n### in their portfolios, making market cap a critical criterion. \n\n### Despite Kaia’s technical excellence, the leveling of layer-1 network \n\n### technologies means differentiation through technology alone is tough. To \n\n### thrive, we must enter the top tier of market cap within 1–2 years, ensuring \n\n### continued user adoption and economic growth through institutional investor \n\n### inflows. \n\n## Any final words? \n\n### On behalf of all developers from our team as well as the Finschia team, I can \n\n### say that we firmly believe in blockchain’s potential to create a transparent \n\n### and fair society. However, we have also faced technical limitations and \n\n### fragmented investments, which have hindered effective user experiences. \n\n### This means we constantly ponder how to bring blockchain transparency into \n\n### everyday life. \n\n## Sign up to discover human stories that deepen your understanding of \n\n## the world. \n\n#### Free \n\n Distraction-free reading.

Both Finschia and Klaytn Foundations are actively \n\n### listening to the feedback coming in from governance members and the \n\n### community, and will work together to facilitate alignment between all \n\n### ecosystem contributors up until and beyond the voting process. \n\n### 1. Our Vision for ‘The Merge’ \n\n### 1. ‘The Merge’ proposal aims to combine the Finschia and Klaytn \n\n### ecosystems, two of the largest blockchain infrastructure and web3 \n\n### ecosystems in Asia, to establish the number one blockchain ecosystem in \n\n### the region. \n\n### 2. Anticipating a rapid increase in institutional and public demand for \n\n### Web3, the catalyst being the recent BTC ETF approval, combining the on\n\n### chain assets, infrastructure and user base of both ecosystems we believe \n\n### will result in exponential growth and adoption. \n\n### 3. The newly merged ecosystem and chain will facilitate synergy and \n\n### competitiveness in four key areas: \n\n### 1) Ecosystem: Inheriting LINE and Kakao messenger-based Web3 assets, \n\n### creating a potential user pool of over 250 million web3 users in Asia, 420+ \n\n### DApps, 45+ governance partners, and 450+ Web3 resources. \n\n### 2) Tokenomics: Leveraging the strengths of each blockchain, introducing \n\n### a sustainability-and-value-creation first tokenomics model with an \n\n### innovative 3-layer burning mechanism and optimized inflation. \n\n### 3) Core Network: Combining Ethereum (EVM) and Cosmos (CosmWasm) \n\n### tech stacks, to establish a new network protocol focused on maximum \n\n### interoperability and scalability. \n\n### 4) Governance: Establishing the largest Web3 governance with \n\n### participation from over 45 global entities, focused on stable and \n\n### decentralized governance, while expanding partnerships and \n\n### strengthening community involvement via enhanced delegation features. \n\n### 4. Additionally, post-merge, both foundations will collaborate on new \n\n### business initiatives in areas such as institutional infrastructure, large\n\n## Sign up to discover human stories that deepen your understanding of \n\n## the world. \n\n#### Free \n\n Distraction-free reading.

Community Engagement & Consensus \n\n### As mentioned above, the Finschia and Klaytn Foundations will actively \n\n### engage with governance members and the community to pursue consensus. \n\n### We will conduct the first joint Q&A session on January 19th, with a separate \n\n### Q&A session held for each respective community on January 24th. In \n\n### addition, we will be sharing our ‘Merge Synergy and Strategy’ beginning next \n\n### week, until the voting period to assist our community in getting a clearer \n\n### picture of our vision. Beyond the community Q&A sessions, each Foundation \n\n### will continue to communicate with respective governance partners and \n\n### community members. \n\n### Governance vote opens: 2024.01.26 (Fri) 05:00 UTC \n\n### Governance vote closes: 2024.02.02 (Fri) 05:00 UTC \n\n### 3.

All \n\n### existing assets and resources will be combined. LINE NEXT, a LINE Web3 \n\n### subsidiary together with GROUND X, a Kakao subsidiary, will continue \n\n### cooperating with the newly established foundation, participating in \n\n### governance and contributing to the ecosystem as before. \n\n### Q3) Won’t there be a difference in voting power if governance of the two \n\n### chains is merged? \n\n### A3) During the merging of governance, if an existing member lacks the \n\n### minimum staking amount due to changes in validation criteria, the newly \n\n### established foundation will provide token delegation support accordingly, \n\n### based on partner contributions and feedback from other members. Concrete \n\n### governance structure and policies will be finalized upon the approval of the \n\n### proposal, prior to any merging of governance. \n\n### Q4) Why wasn’t the merge proposal shared with governance members and \n\n### community beforehand? \n\n### A4) Due to the scale of the proposal, maintaining security and avoiding \n\n### market manipulation was of utmost priority in order to ensure a valid and \n\n### level voting process. Both foundations decided the best approach was to \n\n### simultaneously upload the merge proposal without prior consultation in \n\n### order to maintain neutrality and objectiveness. \n\n## Sign up to discover human stories that deepen your understanding of \n\n## the world. \n\n#### Free \n\n Distraction-free reading.

Post-merge, \n\n### the newly established foundation will take over existing milestones while \n\n### pursuing new ecosystem initiatives, leveraging newly combined resources. \n\n### Both the Finschia and Klaytn foundations believe the merge proposal will act \n\n### as a catalyst for the new era of growth and expansion, spearheading the \n\n### transformation and advancement of Asia’s Web3 industry.

    "# How to Index KIP7 Transfer on Kaia \n\n# using Envio + Quicknode \n\n#### Kaia Foundation · Follow \n\n Published in Kaia · 5 min read · Oct 29, 2024 \n\n## Introduction \n\n### Indexing smart contracts is a fundamental component for building fast and \n\n### high-performing decentralized applications. With indexers, developers can \n\n### aggregate application-specific data for quick access, extract complex \n\n### blockchain data in easily queryable formats, and much more, hence \n\n### unlocking faster speed and data reliability for end-users and developers \n\n### alike. \n\nOpen in app Sign up Sign in \n\n Search Write \n\n## Sign up to discover human stories that deepen your understanding of \n\n## the world. \n\n#### Free \n\n Distraction-free reading.

Furthermore, we will utilize Envio to index \n\n### data via an RPC URL. Though this might be suitable for smaller applications, \n\n### as in this guide, it is recommended to use the HyperSync feature coming to \n\n### Kaia for blazing-fast indexing. \n\n## Launching a Smart Contract \n\n### Let’s start by launching a sample KIP7 smart contract on Kairos Testnet. You \n\n### can easily bootstrap a basic KIP7 contract on Kaia Contract Wizard or simply \n\n### use this contract deployed and verified on \n\n### Kaiascan:0x1f1d5027a1e5817d807458008ca6af5c9ad98354. \n\n## Installing Envio \n\n### You can install Envio by running the command below: \n\n npm i -g envio \n\n## Initializing an indexer \n\n### Now that we have envio and the prerequisites installed, the next thing is to \n\n### initialize the indexer and generate a boilerplate to index the transfers in the \n\n### KIP7 contract. \n\n## Sign up to discover human stories that deepen your understanding of \n\n## the world. \n\n#### Free \n\n Distraction-free reading.

Open your terminal in an empty project and run the command below: \n\n envio init \n\n### 2. Give your indexer a name (e.g. “kaia-token-indexer”). \n\n### 3. Choose your preferred language (typescript) and blockchain ecosystem \n\n### (EVM). \n\n### 4. Choose an initialization option (Template) \n\n### 5. Select the preferred template you’d like to use (ERC20) \n\n## Configuring Indexer. \n\n### Indexers generated using the templates will work without any further \n\n### configuration. However, in this case, we will be illustrating the use of \n\n### QuickNode RPC as a data source, and also adding two more events to the \n\n### indexer to demonstrate how to set up an indexer with multiple events. This \n\n### approach showcases the flexibility of the indexing process and provides a \n\n### more comprehensive example. For these reasons, we will have to configure \n\n### the following files: \n\n### config.yaml \n\n### schema.graphql \n\n## Sign up to discover human stories that deepen your understanding of \n\n## the world. \n\n#### Free \n\n Distraction-free reading.

Galactica intends to streamline the traditional ship \n\n### purchasing process by funding ship acquisitions through fractional \n\n### investment with RWA tokens, benefiting both ship owners and investors. \n\n## Revolutionizing Indonesia’s shipping industry \n\n### Indonesia is the ideal region for shipping-related RWA projects — the \n\n### country is rich in minerals, and due to a ban on the export of raw ores, there \n\n### is an active domestic market — and consequently high maritime transport \n\n### demand. In 2023, the government set a goal to modernize the shipping \n\n### industry through the ‘Golden Indonesia 2045’ roadmap, leading to a rise in \n\n### demand for ships both used and new. \n\n### However, Indonesian shipowners face liquidity risks when purchasing ships. \n\n### Pelayaran Korindo identified that the outdated ship financing system \n\n### hinders the growth of the shipping industry. As of 2023, most of the 11,422 \n\n### ships registered in Indonesia are classified as aged, being over 25 years old. \n\n### Galactica plans to improve global individual investors’ accessibility through \n\n### the digitalization of ship financing and introducing ship-related RWA token \n\n### products to the global market. \n\n### “We are pleased to introduce a tokenization project for a new RWA product \n\n### called ship financing in collaboration with Pelayaran Korindo and InvestaX. \n\n### Galactica aims to expand its digital asset investment portfolio for various \n\n### types of ships in more countries. This will contribute to the digitalization of \n\n### traditional shipping finance, attracting global capital, and expanding Kaia’s \n\n## Sign up to discover human stories that deepen your understanding of \n\n## the world. \n\n#### Free \n\n Distraction-free reading.

Galactica, Kaia’s \n\n### flagship RWA token project, will serve as a solid example of RWA asset \n\n### tokenization while also enhancing collaboration systems with various RWA \n\n### partners to enrich the Kaia RWA ecosystem.” \n\n- Chairman Sangmin Seo of Kaia DLT Foundation \n\n### About Galactica \n\n### Galactica is a joint venture between Kaia Foundation and Pelayaran Korindo, \n\n### conducting a ship financing RWA tokenization project based in Indonesia, \n\n### where domestic maritime transport demand is surging. The company plans \n\n### to improve the rigid ship purchasing process and enable investors to gain \n\n### more shipping operation profits through the continuous introduction of ship \n\n### RWA token products.

DApps that adopt innovative structures, such as on-chain orderbooks and hybrid DEXs, as well as existing ecosystem participants that meet the requirements of D2I are also eligible for the program. \n\n Additionally, a separate Liquidity Incentive has been created to complement D2I, which will be granted to approved DApps after a thorough review of their strategy to effectively leverage the incentive program to attract and sustain TVL. \n\n D2I Program Review Process All D2I applicants will be reviewed by the D2I Grant Committee, a working group of subject matter experts, through a transparent and fair review process. This committee includes core members from Klaytn and Finschia foundations, as well as external industry luminaries to provide expertise and objectivity.

As global blue-chip DeFi projects, each of these teams have their own unique strengths, and we believe that they will create synergies within the larger Dragon Chain ecosystem. \n\n About iZUMi Website | Twitter | Docs | Medium \n\n iZUMi Finance is a one-stop service decentralized finance protocol. Based on the philosophy that every token deserves better on-chain liquidity efficiently and continuously, iZUMi Finance operates an intuitive and easy-to-use DEX service. As a multi-chain DEX utilizing a decentralized liquidity-AMM model, iZUMi has accumulated 14 million transactions, deployed on multi-chains including zkSync Era, Mantle, Manta Network, ZKFair, Linea, Scroll, and BNB Chain. iZUMi Finance manages over $100 million in liquidity for 2.8 million users and leading institutions including global VCs such as Mirana, HASHKEY, IOSG, and BIXIN Ventures. Relevant real-time statistics can be found on this dashboard. \n\n As such, iZUMi Finance powers iZiSwap, a top multi-chain DEX brand with a DL-AMM (decentralized liquidity AMM) design. With over $100 million in TVL and 1 million MAUs, iZiSwap is the first centralized liquidity DEX to support on-chain order book functionality like CEX. iZiSwap also offers DEXas-a-Service, iZUMi’s unique solution for adapting to the rapidly growing Layer 2 and new public chain landscape. The DaaS solution is specifically tailored for public chains, run by an independent team, and empowers $iZi holders. \n\n About Wombat Exchange \n\n## Sign up to discover human stories that deepen your understanding of \n\n## the world. \n\n Free \n\n Distraction-free reading.

It offers an innovative protocol that allows users to swap, bridge, and monetize from one unique pool, boasting over $3.55B in cumulative trading volume and $14.42M in daily trading volume. Meanwhile, Wombat’s open liquidity pool allows staking with a single token, facilitating easy liquidity growth and ensuring maximum capital efficiency and asset scalability. \n\n On top of this liquidity pool, Wombat Exchange has built a Bribe Market with a gamification element to give users incentives beyond just LPs. This incentivizes users to do fun activities that add value to the Wombat ecosystem and its partners. \n\n Specifically, as a D2I partner, Wombat Exchange is showcasing a Dragon Chain-native, single-sided liquidity DEX covering full range of assets in DeFi called Capybara. Being an affiliate of Wombat Exchange, Capybara runs on the battle tested hyper-capital-efficient proprietary algorithm & utilizes WomPets, the sustainable Gamified Bribe Market 2.0. \n\n About Dragonswap Website | Twitter | Medium \n\n Dragon Swap is an all-in-one DEX native to the Klaytn & Finschia integrated chain. Attracting over $6M in TVL in less than a month after launch, and ranking second in Klaytn’s DEX hierarchy, Dragon Swap has achieved impressive early results, as it has also reached $50M in cumulative trading volume. \n\n This solidifies Dragonswap as a platform with a vision that goes beyond facilitating transactions, especially with implementing the KLAY burn initiative. The KLAY burn mechanism, which burns 30% of the protocol’s revenue, is in line with the vision of the D2I proposal and will serve as a \n\n## Sign up to discover human stories that deepen your understanding of \n\n## the world. \n\n Free \n\n Distraction-free reading.

Monthly burns can be found on the Dragonswap Medium. \n\n Dragonswap, in particular, has extensive experience in traditional finance, cryptocurrency exchanges, and blockchain projects, and will be able to bring many partners into the integrated chain ecosystem. \n\n As the first beneficiaries of the D2I program, the three teams are expected to lay the groundwork for a more robust DeFi ecosystem as the program takes hold.

Kaia is committed to building Asia’s \n\n### largest governance based on decentralization and interoperability. To \n\n### achieve this, we are introducing Kaia’s Community Committee to serve as a \n\n### catalyst for more community participation and checks and balances. \n\n### The Kaia Community Committee is a subset of the Kaia Governance Council, \n\n### which is responsible for developing and executing new projects and \n\nOpen in app Sign up Sign in \n\n Search Write \n\n## Sign up to discover human stories that deepen your understanding of \n\n## the world. \n\n#### Free \n\n Distraction-free reading.

By working in conjunction with the \n\n### Governance Council, which has limited participation from smaller \n\n### communities or individuals, the Community Committee is expected to make \n\n### a significant contribution to building a more empowered and autonomous \n\n### Kaia ecosystem. \n\n### Community Committees are organized into two main groups: Chairman and \n\n### Members. Chairman applicants are responsible for organizing the members \n\n### of the committees they want to join, and publicly submit their proposals, \n\n### including ideas and budgets, to the forum. After a first round of review, the \n\n### finalized proposal will be put to a vote by the Governance Council. If passed, \n\n### the Community Council will begin operating under that proposal for a \n\n### period of one year, with the official launch of Kaia Chain, which may vary \n\n### depending on the voted proposal content. More details can be found in the \n\n### full proposal. \n\n### As we aim to build the largest governance chain in Asia, the Kaia ecosystem \n\n### needs more ideas and participation from the community. We look forward to \n\n### your interest and participation in the Community Committees program and \n\n### hope to build a robust Kaia ecosystem together. \n\n### FAQ \n\n### How long will the program run for? \n\n- The program will launch simultaneously with the Kaia Chain launch. Its \n\n### initial period of operation is one year, after which the Governance \n\n### Council will vote to extend it. \n\n### Are there any sector restrictions for community committees to propose? \n\n- You can include any topic as long as it’s an idea that the Kaia community \n\n### has input on and can contribute to the ecosystem. However, all selections \n\n### will be decided by a governance vote. \n\n## Sign up to discover human stories that deepen your understanding of \n\n## the world. \n\n#### Free \n\n Distraction-free reading.

Chairman candidates must provide the \n\n### required one-year operating budget for each line item in their proposal, \n\n### and the amount is not limited. \n\n- However, the proposal should specifically include items such as \n\n### community committee management (development of operational tools, \n\n### operational incentives, etc.), ecosystem investments, marketing, grants, \n\n### and liquidity provision. \n\n### How do I submit a committee plan? \n\n- They can be publicly uploaded to the Notice category in the Governance \n\n### Forum starting May 20th, when the article is published. \n\n- Proposals are submitted by a candidate for Commission Chairman and \n\n### must be agreed upon with Community Commission members prior to \n\n### submission. \n\n### Are there selection criteria for Community Committees? \n\n- Community Committees are selected based entirely on feedback from \n\n### ecosystem partners and participants.

To this end, we’re proud to introduce “Kaia Consensus \n\n### Liquidity”, a groundbreaking DeFi innovation that aims to bolster the Kaia’s \n\n### economic security while expanding its DeFi ecosystem through deep \n\n### liquidity. In this article, we’ll delve into the key features, characteristics, and \n\n### milestones of Kaia Consensus Liquidity (CL). \n\nOpen in app Sign up Sign in \n\n Search Write \n\n## Sign up to discover human stories that deepen your understanding of \n\n## the world. \n\n#### Free \n\n Distraction-free reading.

Final \n\n### specifications, details, and the official name will be shared when we create a \n\n### governance proposal. \n\n## What is Kaia Consensus Liquidity? \n\n### Kaia Consensus Liquidity is an innovative solution that enables simultaneous \n\n### participation in validator staking and DEX liquidity provision on Kaia. With \n\n### CL, General users will be able to utilize a portion of their staked KAIA \n\n### towards the creation of a CL liquidity pool by pairing their project’s token \n\n### with KAIA — subject to governance approval of course. \n\n## Sign up to discover human stories that deepen your understanding of \n\n## the world. \n\n#### Free \n\n Distraction-free reading.

However, at the same time KAIA \n\n### needs to be available as tradable liquidity to energize the ecosystem and \n\n### provide diverse utilities. \n\n### With CL, general users will be able to continue securing the Kaia ecosystem \n\n### while also contributing to the vibrancy of Kaia’s DeFi ecosystem through LP \n\n### provision. In doing so, the general users will be able to continue earning \n\n### block rewards while also earning swap fees from that LP — eliminating the \n\n### need to separate DEX liquidity provision and validator staking. On the other \n\n### side, users will be able to enjoy the benefits of deeper liquidity in Kaia’s DeFi \n\n### ecosystem. The result? A positive synergy for both the Kaia ecosystem and \n\n### CL token projects. \n\n## Greater Participation, Enhanced Rewards \n\n### Kaia Consensus Liquidity promises several benefits for the Kaia ecosystem: \n\n### Amplified rewards: Participating users earn dual rewards through a \n\n### single KAIA deposit, bypassing the need for separate engagements in \n\n### DEX liquidity provision and validator staking. \n\n### Boosted chain TVL: Large-scale liquidity creation through KAIA and \n\n### other token pairs will significantly increase the chain’s Total Value \n\n### Locked (TVL). \n\n### Ecosystem-enhancing fee burning: A portion of the CL DEX fee revenue \n\n### from the foundation and CL participants will be burned or re-deposited \n\n### in liquidity. \n\n### Organic synergy: Partnerships with global token projects participating in \n\n### CL will foster organic synergy within the Kaia ecosystem, driving \n\n### expansion and sustainability. \n\n## Sign up to discover human stories that deepen your understanding of \n\n## the world. \n\n#### Free \n\n Distraction-free reading.

To this end, the Kaia DLT Foundation will offer various incentives to \n\n### entice participation from outstanding projects, paving the way for more \n\n### quality projects to join as CL participants. \n\n### Kaia ecosystem synergy \n\n### The projects and their tokens that are participating in CL (CL tokens) will \n\n### receive priority consideration for new Kaia mainnet features. Projects \n\n### participating in CL can collaborate with the foundation on Kaia \n\n### ecosystem expansion programs, fostering mutual benefits. The \n\n### foundation aims to onboard projects from diverse sectors like gaming \n\n### and social media that can enhance Kaia’s ecosystem. \n\n### New utility development \n\n### The foundation is exploring new features to enhance utility for CL \n\n### tokens. One notable utility enhancement under discussion is the \n\n### prioritization of CL tokens for review and selection as gas payment \n\n### options when Gas Abstraction is implemented. More details will be \n\n### shared in due course. \n\n### Sustainable token economics \n\n### CL tokens can benefit from a portion of CL DEX swap fees (in KAIA and \n\n### CL tokens) being burned or re-deposited into liquidity as needed. This \n\n### mechanism helps maintain the continuity of CL token projects’ existing \n\n### token economies. \n\n## Key Features \n\n### Liquidity Pool Creation: Forms liquidity pools with KAIA and the CL \n\n### tokens approved through Kaia governance. \n\n### Staking and Liquidity Provision: Participants can utilize a portion of \n\n### their staked KAIA to simultaneously engage in DEX liquidity provision \n\n### and validator staking. \n\n## Sign up to discover human stories that deepen your understanding of \n\n## the world. \n\n#### Free \n\n Distraction-free reading.

DEX swap \n\n### fees are automatically distributed according to the LP’s liquidity \n\n### provision contribution. \n\n### Can it be used in all liquidity pools? \n\n### Pairs are formed with KAIA only for CL tokens approved by Kaia \n\n### governance and can only be used in those liquidity pools. \n\n### How are CL participants and tokens selected? \n\n### The foundation selects candidate tokens from various industries such as \n\n### gaming and social media that can provide visible and positive synergy \n\n### effects to the Kaia ecosystem. They are confirmed as CL tokens upon \n\n### approval by Kaia governance. \n\n### What is the first CL token and when will it be announced? \n\n### We are currently in productive discussions with participants who can \n\n### make long-term stable contributions to the Kaia ecosystem. We \n\n### appreciate your interest and patience. \n\n### What benefits can liquidity providers gain? \n\n### With a single deposit, you can secure both validator staking rewards and \n\n### additional income from DEX liquidity provision simultaneously. \n\n### What utility will CL tokens have on the Kaia mainnet? \n\n### As CL tokens are Kaia-based tokens, they will be prioritized when \n\n### introducing new features to the Kaia mainnet, such as being accepted as \n\n### a payment option for Gas Abstraction. \n\n### Won’t CL decrease KAIA staking APY? \n\n### A portion of the foundation’s fee revenue from CL DEX can be burned or \n\n### re-deposited into liquidity. While the apparent APY may decrease due to \n\n### increased staking volume, this decrease is minimal at less than 0.01%. \n\n### Considering the value appreciation effect due to the burning policy for \n\n### ecosystem reinvestment, the real staking APY could potentially increase \n\n## Sign up to discover human stories that deepen your understanding of \n\n## the world. \n\n#### Free \n\n Distraction-free reading.

    "# Kaia D2I Program Report \n\n### Future Directions for Kaia DeFi \n\n Kaia Foundation · Follow Published in Kaia · 5 min read · Nov 22, 2024 \n\n 1 \n\n The D2I program is an incentive initiative tailored to Kaia(formerly Klaytn). It aims to swiftly rebuild Kaia’s DeFi ecosystem and establish a financial infrastructure for new DApps onboarding before the chain merge. \n\n During the DeFi Summer of 2021, Kaia saw an influx of liquidity through mining. However, the on-chain bubble burst in 2022 led to a significant contraction of the on-chain economy. Kaia’s competitiveness weakened \n\nOpen in app Sign up Sign in \n\n Search Write \n\n## Sign up to discover human stories that deepen your understanding of \n\n## the world. \n\n Free \n\n Distraction-free reading.

However, the depegging of bridged assets earlier this year distorted the on-chain value of KCT. This created bad debt across various DApps offering liquidity borrowing services (such as Lending, CDP, and Leveraged Yield Farming) and left general DApps struggling with accurate asset pricing. As a result, DeFi became challenging for users to engage with on Kaia. \n\n The program’s immediate goal is to revitalize this underutilized ecosystem and build a financial infrastructure for new DApps after the merge. Its longterm objective is to reinvigorate Kaia’s DeFi ecosystem. \n\n In the first half of 2024, three DEXes were selected as D2I partners: two v3 AMM (Spot) DEXes — Dragonswap and Kaiaswap — and one Coverage Ratio AMM (Spot) DEX, CapyBara. Despite Kaiaswap’s recent departure, the remaining two teams continue to build within the ecosystem. \n\n Since their launch, these teams have collectively achieved impressive results: over $710 million in swap volume, more than $39 million in TVL, 3.1 million+ swap transactions, 260,000+ cumulative users, and over 245,000 KAIA burned. Notably, for $KAIA, the on-chain DEXes now generate trading volumes comparable to Binance. \n\n Detailed metrics are available through each team’s analytics page and various on-chain data providers: \n\n Analytics Pages \n\n Dragonswap CapyBara Spot \n\n Onchain Data Providers \n\n## Sign up to discover human stories that deepen your understanding of \n\n## the world. \n\n Free \n\n Distraction-free reading.

They’re continually adding features such as Launchpads, Meme Platforms, Liquidity Managers, Raffles, and Perpetual Futures. \n\n This robust infrastructure now allows all Kaia ecosystem DApps — including those on the upcoming Line Miniapp platform — to easily establish on-chain ecosystems by leveraging these features. \n\n Launchpad: Capy IDO, KnightFury Liquidity Manager: KibbleFarm Raffles: Capy Raffle Perpetual Futures: Capy Perp \n\n Additionally, both teams are actively collaborating with partners to enhance synergies. These partnerships include Lair Finance (LSD & LRT), Superwalk (M2E), KnightFury (Launchpad), Smart Layer (Token as Apps Platform), Fusionist (Gaming), and Kaiafun (Memecoin Platform). Strong integrations with the Miniapp ecosystem are also expected. \n\n## Future Directions for Kaia DeFi \n\n## Sign up to discover human stories that deepen your understanding of \n\n## the world. \n\n Free \n\n Distraction-free reading.

It’s shifting from complex “money legos” (such as Yield Aggregators and Leveraged Yield Farming) towards derivatives primarily based on native coins and stablecoins. This change aligns with growing institutional demand. \n\n As the core financial infrastructure (Spot DEX and Money Market) stabilizes, we’ll focus on creating derivatives based on native coins and stablecoins (e.g., LSDfi, LRTfi, Yield Stripping Derivatives). Our primary goal is to increase exposure to LSD and LRT, enabling Kaia’s native coin to play an active role in the DeFi ecosystem. \n\n## Appendix: Introducing Avalon Finance \n\n What is Avalon? Avalon Labs stands as the leading Bitcoin-focused lending ecosystem, uniquely positioned at the intersection of DeFi, CeDeFi, and RWA (RealWorld Asset) lending. By bridging these three key areas, Avalon Labs has established itself as a cornerstone in the rapidly evolving landscape of decentralized finance. Formerly known as Avalon Finance, the platform has become the largest lending marketplace dedicated to Bitcoin Layer 2 solutions and liquid staking derivatives (LSDs). \n\n Avalon Labs pioneers the integration of overcollateralized Bitcoin-backed loans, offering seamless access to fiat liquidity using Bitcoin as collateral. Focused on unlocking Bitcoin’s full potential, Avalon Labs is not only transforming how digital assets are leveraged in DeFi but also spearheading innovation in CeDeFi to meet institutional needs — particularly Bitcoin\n\n## Sign up to discover human stories that deepen your understanding of \n\n## the world. \n\n Free \n\n Distraction-free reading.

Through its dynamic platform, Avalon Labs is shaping the future of Bitcoin finance, where decentralized and centralized models converge to create more efficient, scalable, and secure lending solutions. \n\n Why We Are Building on Kaia Chain Avalon Labs is building on the Kaia chain to leverage its focus on community, sustainability, and simplicity — values that align with Avalon’s vision for decentralized finance. Kaia’s emphasis on fostering inclusive ecosystems and promoting blockchain adoption through user-friendly, opensource technology makes it an ideal platform for Avalon to expand its CeDeFi and BTC LSDFi initiatives. By streamlining blockchain experiences for users worldwide, Kaia offers Avalon Labs the opportunity to engage a broader audience while building products on a foundation that prioritizes long-term impact and growth. \n\n The Kaia chain’s collaboration with leading DeFi projects and strategic partnerships, including the integration of global blue-chip DeFi protocols, provides Avalon Labs with a robust ecosystem to enhance liquidity and security for its lending products. Kaia’s commitment to simplifying DeFi, exemplified by its partnership with LINE NEXT, ensures that Avalon Labs can deliver a seamless and accessible user experience — crucial for the mass adoption of their innovative financial solutions. By building on Kaia, Avalon Labs is well-positioned to expand its footprint in the rapidly evolving blockchain space, capitalizing on Kaia’s strong technological infrastructure and forward-thinking approach. \n\n What have we achieved so far? Avalon Labs is pioneering CeDeFi lending with the industry’s first Bitcoinbacked loans for fiat at a fixed 8% APR — an industry low. Since our February launch, we’ve achieved exceptional product-market fit, with over $100 million in market value and more than $40 million in active loans. Our growth has been remarkable, with total value locked (TVL) exceeding $725 million, making us one of the fastest-growing lending platforms. Our 15person team has unlocked significant value across multiple chains, cementing our leadership on Bitlayer BTC L2, Merlin, and other prominent \n\n## Sign up to discover human stories that deepen your understanding of \n\n## the world. \n\n Free \n\n Distraction-free reading.

We remain deeply committed to L1 primitives, actively collaborating on the BNB chain. \n\n A key differentiator is their early adoption of FBTC as collateral, a cuttingedge asset class. Avalon Labs’s close partnership with Babylon validates our approach — we’re among the first lending protocols recognized by Babylon, with plans to list over 8 LSDfi assets within the month. They’re also developing our first collateralized debt position (CDP), drawing comparisons to $DAI in stablecoin innovation. With $725 million in TVL and $225 million in outstanding loans across chains, Avalon Labs ensures no asset sits idle, maximizing capital efficiency and yield generation throughout the ecosystem. \n\n What values will you be bringing to the chain? Avalon Labs is committed to bringing their 80–90k active users and substantial Total Value Locked (TVL) to Kaia Chain, expanding its visibility beyond the Asia-Pacific region into niche markets worldwide. Their efforts will drive Kaia Chain’s global reach, positioning it as a key player in the blockchain ecosystem. By leveraging Kaia’s seamless Web2 touchpoints, Avalon Labs will play a pivotal role in onboarding millions of users, ensuring widespread adoption. They will also actively engage with their partners to advocate for Kaia Chain, introducing and integrating those who align with Kaia’s vision. Together, Avalon Labs aims to support Kaia in reaching its full potential on the world stage. \n\n Published in Kaia 209 Followers · Last published 2 days ago Kaia is a high performance public blockchain that simplifies Web3 for users, builders, investors, enterprises, and everyone in-between. \n\n Follow \n\n English Kaia Chain Ecosystem Avalonlabs Blockchain \n\n## Sign up to discover human stories that deepen your understanding of \n\n## the world. \n\n Free \n\n Distraction-free reading.

Integration work has been progressing steadily, but a chain merge of \n\n### this scale has never been attempted before, so there’s still a ton that needs to \n\n### be done. Here’s an update on the progress that we’ve made as we prepare to \n\n### launch into new frontiers! \n\n### Over the past few weeks, key partners that will form the core of Kaia’s DeFi \n\n### infrastructure and ecosystem have been onboarded onto Klaytn, and will be \n\n### live on Kaia once the mainnet launches.

A long-standing ecosystem partner has also \n\n### begun work on a Kaia block explorer, which will be ready on day one as well. \n\n### The merging of our community and social platforms have also begun, \n\n### starting with Discord. Preparations have also been made for the Kaia blog \n\n### and social media accounts, which will be launched closer to the date when \n\n### the mainnet will go live. \n\n### As for core development, we have completed work on the Kairos testnet, \n\n### which has just gone live. Development work for the Kaia mainnet is well \n\n### underway, with the first of multiple security audits having been completed. \n\n### However, the launch of the Kaia mainnet will need to be pushed back slightly \n\n### to Q3 2024 as the registration process for the Kaia DLT Foundation is taking \n\n### longer than initially expected. \n\n### The reason the foundation needs to be established before the mainnet can \n\n### be launched is because we firmly believe that regulatory compliance is \n\n### necessary for the creation of a blockchain ecosystem that can be widely \n\n### adopted across Asia with minimal roadblocks. \n\n### To this end, we have been working closely with the Abu Dhabi Global Market \n\n### (ADGM) to ensure that the Kaia DLT Foundation is established in accordance \n\n### with their carefully-constructed regulatory framework, which is designed to \n\n### encourage the healthy growth of the blockchain industry. Our aim is for Kaia \n\n### DLT Foundation to be a leading example of how the blockchain industry can \n\n### work hand-in-hand with regulatory authorities to bring the benefits of Web3 \n\n### to the broader population. \n\n### On this front, we have also been working on two initiatives that will be \n\n### released together with the Kaia mainnet — the Kaia Portal and public \n\n### delegation capabilities. \n\n## Sign up to discover human stories that deepen your understanding of \n\n## the world. \n\n#### Free \n\n Distraction-free reading.

Accessible through Kaia Square, Public Delegation will enable \n\n### KAIA holders to participate in Kaia governance through the delegation of \n\n### their voting power, while also earning their share of the block rewards \n\n### earned by the validator. \n\n### Previously, Klaytn’s Public Staking service required each GC member to \n\n### independently develop public staking functionality, which was not only time \n\n### and resource intensive but also led to fragmentation in implementation. \n\n### With Public Delegation, Kaia validators will be able to tap on a library of \n\n### open source smart contracts to implement the delegation feature, ensuring \n\n### greater consistency and standardization while also simplifying the \n\n### implementation of the feature. This is expected to result in a wider selection \n\n### of validators for users to delegate to, while also encouraging healthy \n\n### competition between validators which will undoubtedly be beneficial for \n\n### end users. \n\n### After the initial launch of Public Delegation, the foundation will jointly \n\n### explore further improvements such as a unified standard for LST, support \n\n### for re-delegation, and more with the Kaia Governance Council members. \n\n### Published in Kaia \n\n 209 Followers · Last published 2 days ago \n\n Kaia is a high performance public blockchain that simplifies Web3 for users, builders, investors, enterprises, and everyone in-between. \n\n Follow \n\n### Written by Kaia Foundation \n\n 287 Followers · 5 Following \n\n Follow \n\n English Kaia Chain Blockchain Cryptocurrency \n\n## Sign up to discover human stories that deepen your understanding of \n\n## the world. \n\n#### Free \n\n Distraction-free reading.

    "# Kaia Testnet ‘Kairos’ Launch \n\n#### Kaia Foundation · Follow \n\n Published in Kaia · 3 min read · Jul 15, 2024 \n\n### We are pleased to announce the launch of Kaia v1.0.0 Testnet ‘Kairos’. \n\n### Kaia v1.0.0 is the first official release of the Kaia chain. The Kaia network \n\n### starts by transitioning the Klaytn network at a transition hardfork. At the \n\n### moment the hardfork is applied, the Klaytn Baobab testnet will transition \n\n### into the Kairos testnet. The Kaia Transition hardfork and KIP-160 hardfork \n\n### configurations are included in this version. For the mainnet hardfork block \n\n### number, it will be announced with the next version. \n\nOpen in app Sign up Sign in \n\n Search Write \n\n## Sign up to discover human stories that deepen your understanding of \n\n## the world. \n\n#### Free \n\n Distraction-free reading.

All testnet nodes must be upgraded to \n\n### v1.0.0 or later before the target block number. \n\n### Hardfork schedule for the testnet \n\n### Block number: 156660000 (estimated time: 13 Jun, 10:13 UTC+9) \n\n### Hardfork contents: Kaia Transition hardfork, KIP-160 hardfork \n\n### Kaia’s feature highlight \n\n### KAIA is the native token of the Kaia chain, used for paying gas fees. KAIA \n\n### tokens are distributed every block to block validators and community \n\n### funds to support node operations and ecosystem growth. The validator \n\n### portion of the block reward comprises the proposer reward for \n\n### participating in block creation and the staking rewards for the staking \n\n### KAIA, recognizing both operational and economic contributions. \n\n### Kaia chain, utilizing IBFT (Istanbul BFT) consensus, aims to be an \n\n### enterprise-grade blockchain prioritizing secure and efficient service \n\n### delivery. Kaia blocks are generated once every second and are instantly \n\n### finalized, avoiding temporal uncertainty. In addition, Kaia’s specialized \n\n### node roles (CN, PN, EN) ensure stable and efficient network operation. \n\n### Kaia chain extends the concept of EOA (Externally Owned Account) to \n\n### include private key replacement functionality, advanced multi-sig, and \n\n### role-based access control, and practical account management without \n\n### the need for smart contracts. In addition, the platform supports the Fee \n\n### Delegation feature, allowing service providers to sponsor service users \n\n### for gas without the need for smart contracts. \n\n### On-chain governance drives the Kaia chain. The validators’ voting powers \n\n### are calculated from the staked KAIA amounts in the staking smart \n\n### contracts. Based on these voting powers, validators can vote on network \n\n### configuration changes, fund disbursement, and other agendas, deciding \n\n### the chain’s future. Anyone can transparently verify that the governance \n\n### process is transparently happening on-chain smart contracts. \n\n## Sign up to discover human stories that deepen your understanding of \n\n## the world. \n\n#### Free \n\n Distraction-free reading.

A VRF (Verifiable Random Function) \n\n### based on BLS signatures produces random numbers for every block that \n\n### decides the next block proposer. Since the random numbers are derived \n\n### from validators’ BLS private keys, it is impossible for any entity to predict \n\n### them in advance, yet they can be verified against the published BLS \n\n### public keys. \n\n### Users can delegate their KAIA tokens to validators. By delegating KAIA \n\n### tokens, the user gives the validator more voting power and helps them \n\n### earn the block producer qualification. Then, the validator shares the \n\n### block rewards with the users according to their delegation contributions. \n\n### The priority fee mechanism is introduced to the Kaia chain. When \n\n### transactions are included in a block, they are first sorted in the order of \n\n### highest priority fee, then the order of arrival time on the consensus node. \n\n### Transaction gas fees, comprising the base fee and priority fee, are burned \n\n### up to the block proposer’s reward limit, contributing to the token’s \n\n### deflationary model and increasing its value. \n\n### The Kaia v1.0.0 binary can be downloaded from the links below. For more \n\n### details, refer to the GitHub release note. The binary executables are \n\n### distributed for this version. For docker images, tarball, and rpm packages, it \n\n### will be published in the following versions. \n\n### linux/amd64: kcn kpn ken \n\n### You can test the Kaia RPC through the public JSON-RPC endpoints below. \n\n### (Note: Previous URLs remain active for service continuity.) \n\n### https://public-en-kairos.node.kaia.io \n\n### https://public-en-baobab.klaytn.net \n\n English Kaia Chain Blockchain Cryptocurrency \n\n## Sign up to discover human stories that deepen your understanding of \n\n## the world. \n\n#### Free \n\n Distraction-free reading.

    "# Kaia v1.0.1 Release Notice \n\n Kaia Foundation · Follow Published in Kaia · 3 min read · Jul 18, 2024 \n\n 1 \n\n We are pleased to announce that Kaia v1.0.1 has been released. \n\n This version contains fixes and improvements over v1.0.0. The mainnet hardfork block number will be included in a later version. \n\n Notices Versions v1.0.0 and v1.0.1 contain notable transaction fees and API interface changes. Please review these changes thoroughly to ensure smooth engagement with the Kaia blockchain. \n\nOpen in app Sign up Sign in \n\n Search Write \n\n## Sign up to discover human stories that deepen your understanding of \n\n## the world. \n\n Free \n\n Distraction-free reading.

KIP-162 is similar to EIP-1559, where a gas price is the base fee plus a priority fee (tip). \n\n If your dApp or wallet utilizes type-2 transactions (EIP-1559), ensure you set a reasonable priority fee. You can also call the eth_maxPriorityFeePerGas API to retrieve the recommended tip. \n\n If your dApp or wallet utilizes other types like legacy (type-0) or feedelegated transaction types, be careful when setting the gasPrice because you’ll pay the full gasPrice for the transaction. For instance, if you declare gasPrice as 500 gkei, under the lowest base fee, the transaction will pay 25 gkei for the base fee and 475 gkei for the priority fee. To pay an appropriate gas price, it is recommended to call the eth_gasPrice API to retrieve the recommended gasPrice. \n\n Read more about Kaia’s guide to transaction fees. \n\n To dApp developers utilizing message signing APIs The JSON-RPC APIs related to message signing (eth_sign, kaia_sign, personal_sign, personal_ecRecover) are going to support EIP-191 (Ethereum Signed Message prefix) and move away from KIP-97 for better compatibility with Ethereum ecosystem tools. \n\n This change only affects instances where a Kaia node signs messages using private keys stored within the node itself. Transaction signatures remain unaffected. You can also continue using the KIP-97 standard with caver-js, caver-java, and previous versions of the Kaia node. Read more about message signing standards in the docs and pull request. \n\n To debug trace consumers The callTracer and fastCallTracer results from the debug trace RPCs and chaindatafetcher have been refined to more accurately reflect transaction \n\n## Sign up to discover human stories that deepen your understanding of \n\n## the world. \n\n Free \n\n Distraction-free reading.

See the pull request for the changes and examples. Find more about debug traces in the [docs](insert link here). \n\n To node operators For backward compatibility, the RPC namespaces “kaia” and “klay” are both supported and functionally identical. Similarly, the network selection flags “ — cypress” and “ — mainnet” are interchangeable, as are the flags “ — baobab” and “ — kairos.” However, the “ — testnet” flag is removed as the testnet is now called Kairos. \n\n The binary packages in .tar.gz and .rpm formats, as well as the docker images, are distributed starting from this version. Please find the most suitable format for your installation. \n\n Improvements Updated message signing RPCs to be EIP-191 compliant and move away from KIP-97 (#33) Improved system contracts related to KIP-160, KIP-163 and KAIA token bridge (#2210, #2211, #18, #24) Added type-2 transaction support to the Go RPC client (#29, #41) \n\n Fixes Fixed debug_trace* API and chaindatafetcher system to produce more accurate call traces (#15, #16, #43, #47) Fixed eth_gasPrice and eth_maxPriorityFeePerGas to return a reasonable price under low network traffic (#28, #44, #45) Fixed kaia_getTransaction* API to return correct gasPrice (#26) Fixed kaia_getTotalSupply for Kairos testnet (#23) Fixed staking and consensus-related APIs for post-Kaia blocks (#48) Fixed the service chain RPC error (#27) \n\n Miscellaneous \n\n## Sign up to discover human stories that deepen your understanding of \n\n## the world. \n\n Free \n\n Distraction-free reading.

The two \n\n### foundations will form an integrated organization, sharing technologies, \n\n### services, and business networks, working alongside Kakao, LINE, and other \n\n### partners who have contributed to the development and ecosystem expansion \n\n### of their respective mainnets. By doing so, we plan to establish ourselves as \n\n### Asia’s largest Web3 ecosystem, taking the lead to drive blockchain mass \n\n### adoption in the region. \n\n### The creation of Asia’s largest Web3 ecosystem \n\n### Klaytn’s robust technical infrastructure and strong presence in South Korea, \n\n### Singapore, and Vietnam, will be combined with Finschia’s comprehensive \n\n### service network that is popular in Japan, Taiwan, Thailand, and Abu Dhabi. \n\n### Post-merge, Klaytn’s DeFi and gaming services and Finschia’s NFT, payment, \n\n### and AI services will come together to create a massive ecosystem of 420+ \n\n### DApps and services, 45+ governance partners, and 450+ Web3 resources \n\n### (based on foundations and key ecosystem participants) — the largest Web3 \n\n### network in Asia. The merged blockchain will also inherit integration with \n\n### both Kakao and LINE messengers, creating a powerful ecosystem with over \n\n### 250 million potential Asian user touchpoints. \n\n### We expect the integration of Klaytn and Finschia to be a catalyst for the \n\n### creation of new Web3 infrastructure in key Asian countries and supercharge \n\n### scalability and liquidity. \n\n### Post-merge, the unified foundation will continue to pursue ecosystem \n\n### expansion in the RWA tokenization, GameFi and DeFi verticals through \n\n### collaborations with Japanese, South Korean, and Southeast Asian partners, \n\n### while continuing to develop messenger-based Web3 services and the digital \n\n## Sign up to discover human stories that deepen your understanding of \n\n## the world. \n\n#### Free \n\n Distraction-free reading.

With access to every Kakaotalk and LINE user, the new \n\n### public blockchain will also act as a springboard for Asia’s IT and \n\n### entertainment enterprises. \n\n### Should the proposal pass both Klaytn and Finschia’s governance voting \n\n### processes, the two foundations will immediately begin work on the chain \n\n### merge, as well as the following business initiatives: \n\n### Strengthening of the DeFi infrastructure and launch of a native \n\n### stablecoin \n\n### Discovery and onboarding of AI-based DApps \n\n### Enhancing the onboarding infrastructure for Web2 companies to bring \n\n### their digital items, memberships, ticketing platforms and more on-chain \n\n### Onboarding of top-tier Japanese gaming companies and Web3 projects \n\n### featuring global IP \n\n### Cultivating of communities of holders, developers, and partners in each \n\n### Asian country \n\n### Improved tokenomics focused on sustainable value creation \n\n### With the chain merge, KLAY and FNSA, the native coins of the two \n\n### blockchains, will be replaced by a new native coin which will be issued \n\n### based on the combined total amount of KLAY and FNSA. All KLAY and FNSA \n\n### holders will be able to swap for the new coin upon issuance. \n\n### Drawing on the combined experience of both foundations, the proposed \n\n### tokenomics for this new native coin will focus heavily on delivering \n\n### sustainable value creation. This will be achieved via a lower base inflation \n\n### rate and a 3-layer burning model designed to drive the coin towards \n\n### deflation as network activity increases. \n\n## Sign up to discover human stories that deepen your understanding of \n\n## the world. \n\n#### Free \n\n Distraction-free reading.

Instead of operating \n\n### off of reserves, the new foundation will operate transparently via an \n\n### ecosystem fund and an infrastructure fund that are continuously \n\n### replenished via block rewards. \n\n### Enhanced governance, decentralization, and interoperability \n\n### The respective governance of Klaytn and Finschia will also be unified to \n\n### enhance user and community delegation capabilities. The permissionless \n\n### node validation system that the Klaytn Foundation has been promoting will \n\n### also be implemented, creating a transparent, trusted, and open ecosystem. \n\n### To support the seamless migration of existing DApps and services on both \n\n### Klaytn and Finschia, the proposed new blockchain will support both EVM \n\n### and CosmWasm. This makes it accessible to both Ethereum and Cosmos \n\n### builders, allowing them to leverage the technological advantages of each \n\n### while enabling greater interoperability between the two ecosystems. \n\n### “We are excited to be taking the first step toward unlocking the enormous synergy \n\n### of merging the public blockchains started by Kakao and LINE, which are both \n\n### leading IT companies in Asia,” said Klaytn Foundation and Finschia Foundation. \n\n### “We will give our best to make this merge an opportunity to innovate and lead the \n\n### Asian blockchain industry in both technology and adoption.” \n\n### With such a major change being proposed, the two foundations have \n\n### arranged for the upcoming Klaytn Community Town Hall on Friday, January \n\n### 19th to provide an opportunity for open dialogue and clarifications with our \n\n### communities. More information on this Town Hall will be shared on the \n\n### official community and social platforms of Klaytn and Finschia Foundation. \n\n## Sign up to discover human stories that deepen your understanding of \n\n## the world. \n\n#### Free \n\n Distraction-free reading.

The merge proposal was voted on \n\n### by governance members and passed with an overwhelming 95% in favor on \n\n### Finschia’s side and 90% in favor on Klaytn’s side. With this merge, the unified \n\n### network will have approximately 420 DApp services and more than 45 \n\n### governance members, positioning it to popularize Web3 as Asia’s largest \n\n### blockchain ecosystem. \n\n### Operating a Transparent and Fair Unified Foundation \n\n### The two foundations will form a task force to integrate the chains and \n\n### establish a unified foundation in Abu Dhabi, UAE by the second quarter of \n\n### 2024. We will also establish a single governance structure to efficiently \n\n### operate the unified mainnet and transfer our respective organizations and \n\n### tasks to the unified foundation. Leadership of the unified foundation will be \n\n### formed with equal seats from Finschia and Klaytn. As a unified foundation, \n\n### we will leverage our combined expertise to develop and operate a new, more \n\n### decentralized, integrated mainnet compatible with both EVM and \n\n### CosmWasm. \n\n### New Tokenomics, More Participation in Governance \n\n### The new blockchain will also feature all-new tokenomics, merging KLAY and \n\n### FNSA into a single new coin. Uncirculated virtual assets will also be \n\n### eliminated, and governance delegation and community participation will be \n\n### expanded for greater transparency. Furthermore, we plan to promote \n\n### innovation in the Asian blockchain industry through the creation of \n\n### infrastructure to respond to institutional demand, launching native \n\n### stablecoins, promoting new businesses, and collaborating with partners as \n\n### detailed in the merge proposal. \n\n### “There was no one blockchain network that represented the Asian market, \n\n### and the level of community participation had much to be desired,” said \n\n### Youngsu Ko, Chairman of the Finschia Foundation Council. “We plan to \n\n### build Asia’s largest blockchain ecosystem with the diverse opinions from our \n\n## Sign up to discover human stories that deepen your understanding of \n\n## the world. \n\n#### Free \n\n Distraction-free reading.

    "# Klaytn v1.12.1 Release Notice \n\n Kaia Foundation · Follow Published in Kaia · 2 min read · Jul 10, 2024 \n\n We are pleased to announce that Klaytn v1.12.1 has been released. \n\n Klaytn v1.12.1 contains bug fixes and Cypress mainnet hardfork block number configuration. The hardforks have already been applied to the Baobab testnet. \n\n IMPORTANT: Klaytn v1.12.1 contains a hardfork upgrade that results in changes that are not backward compatible. All Cypress nodes must be upgraded to v1.12.0 or later before the target block number. \n\nOpen in app Sign up Sign in \n\n Search Write \n\n## Sign up to discover human stories that deepen your understanding of \n\n## the world. \n\n Free \n\n Distraction-free reading.

The first is equivalent to the features of the Ethereum Cancun hardfork, and the second is an optional hardfork implementing Randao on-chain randomness. Refer to the v1.12.0 Release Notice for details. \n\n Here’s the hardfork schedule for the Cypress mainnet: \n\n Cypress mainnet Block number: 147534000 (estimated time: 04 Mar, 10:00 AM UTC+9) Hardfork contents: Cancun hardfork, Randao hardfork \n\n Notices Public EN operators can enable the rpc.gascap configuration to reduce loads from heavy RPC calls. It is recommended to add the — rpc.gascap 300000000 (300mil gas) flag, but you should choose an appropriate value based on your node’s capacity. \n\n The illegal instruction (SIGILL) error that occurred in v1.12.0 was resolved in v1.12.1. Even if some Intel CPU models do not support certain instructions, the linux-amd64 binary will function. On ARM Macs, the darwin-amd64 binary will work. \n\n Improvements Added the klay_getProof and klay_getProof APIs (#2068) Enhanced information retrieved from the klay_getBlockWithConsensusInfo API and the ‘ken util decode-extra’ command (#2088, #2101) Modified the output values from the default tracer in debug trace APIs, (#2090) Dynamically enabled optimization instructions depending on CPU type to prevent the illegal instruction (SIGILL) error (#2091) \n\n Fixes \n\n## Sign up to discover human stories that deepen your understanding of \n\n## the world. \n\n Free \n\n Distraction-free reading.

Peter Ayo (Kaia Foundation Developer Advocate) \n\n## Introduction \n\n Seamless user experience is key in today’s digital world.

This is where super apps have gained dominance. Originally popularized by WeChat, the super app model offers users a wide range of services — from messaging to e-commerce — without ever leaving the app. \n\n With the advent of blockchain and Dapps, a new window of opportunity has opened up to expand the super app paradigm even further. Super app ecosystems now have the capacity to host mini Dapps, which are decentralized apps that allow users to have the Web3 experience such as wallet creation, digital asset ownership, FT/NFT transactions without the usual Web3 complexities. \n\n LINE NEXT in collaboration with Kaia aims to create a Dapp Portal, where users can access a wide range of decentralized services directly from the messaging app. This powerful combination has the potential to drive mass adoption of Web3 by making it more accessible and user-friendly. In this post, we’ll explore what makes mini Dapps so revolutionary, break down the app-within-an-app model, and examine the rise of Web3 super apps. We’ll also look at real-world use cases for mini Dapps on the Kaia blockchain, and why this model could be a game changer for both developers and users. \n\n## The Life Platform and Mini Dapp Landscape \n\n In the ever-evolving digital landscape, life platforms have emerged as powerful catalysts for widespread digital adoption. These comprehensive platforms give users a single screen where they can access many services, for both personal and commercial needs. Trailblazer apps like LINE are leading the way. They give users access to basic services and let developers make their own mini-apps that add to the platform’s robust features. \n\n A life platform usually starts with a main service, like messaging or social networking, and then adds more services, like healthcare, shopping online, and even travel. Now, imagine enhancing this model with the ability to easily engage in a variety of Web3 activities within the platform, such as creating a \n\n## Sign up to discover human stories that deepen your understanding of \n\n## the world. \n\n Free \n\n Distraction-free reading.

It supports mini-apps, which are small, lightweight web apps that empower developers to create services that can connect directly to LINE’s huge user base. This way, users can have a streamlined, intuitive experience without ever leaving the platform. For example, users don’t have to switch apps to use different services, like making a doctor’s appointment or getting food. \n\n Now, picture Web3 technology being combined with the power of a life platform. Together with Kaia, LINE NEXT aims to become a bridge between Web2 and Web3, reaching a massive real-world audience. They are creating a Web3-enabled Lifestyle Platform by integrating mini Dapps, which are decentralized apps powered by Kaia’s blockchain, into LINE Messenger. This will make using Web3 simple and intuitive for users. \n\n Sample image / source @LINE NEXT \n\n## Background of LINE NEXT and Kaia: The Super Leverage \n\n As we explore the potential of super apps combined with mini-Dapps, it’s essential to understand the key players behind this innovation — LINE NEXT and Kaia. Each brings its own legacy of success, and together, they offer a powerful advantage in shaping a robust mini Dapp ecosystem. This synergy positions them as true pioneers in the Web3 landscape. \n\n## Sign up to discover human stories that deepen your understanding of \n\n## the world. \n\n Free \n\n Distraction-free reading.

It became a gateway to an expansive ecosystem, embracing the app-within-an-app model to provide a variety of services, all within a single, unified interface. Whether it’s messaging, fintech, e-commerce, or entertainment, LINE is a one-stop platform for multiple services, making it a true life platform. \n\n LINE NEXT, with its vast user base spanning Japan, Taiwan, Thailand, and Indonesia, is ideally positioned to introduce Web3 technology to a wide audience. The platform’s potential to integrate mini Dapps (decentralized applications) that will handle various functions such as decentralized finance, digital asset ownership, and X2E gaming, could revolutionize how users interact with blockchain technology in the future. With millions of active users already in place, the transition to Web3 is likely to happen faster than anticipated. \n\n Kaia: Powering Asia’s On-Chain Future At the core of this trend lies the Kaia blockchain. Formed through the merger of Klaytn and Finschia blockchains initially developed by Kakao (another leading super app in South Korea) and LINE respectively. Kaia envisions bringing Web3 to the fingertips of hundreds of millions across Asia. \n\n Kaia being one of the biggest Web3 ecosystems in Asia with a portfolio of 420 distributed apps (Dapps), 45 governance partners, and 34+ millions wallets, offers both the scalability and security required for consumer blockchain applications, therefore enabling the essential foundation for mini-Dapps to flourish. \n\n## The Combined Power of the Mini Dapp Ecosystem \n\n Together, LINE NEXT and Kaia provide a super leverage that could redefine the Web3 mini Dapp ecosystem. Here’s why: \n\n## Sign up to discover human stories that deepen your understanding of \n\n## the world. \n\n Free \n\n Distraction-free reading. No ads. Organize your knowledge with lists and highlights. Tell your story. Find your audience. \n\n Membership \n\n Read member-only stories Support writers you read most Earn money for your writing Listen to audio narrations Read offline with the Medium app \n\n\n Massive User Base: LINE NEXT’s extensive user base offers mini Dapp developers immediate access to millions of potential users, reducing the hurdles to adoption. Developer-Friendly Infrastructure: Kaia’s blockchain technology enables developers to easily build and deploy decentralized apps directly into the LINE ecosystem, allowing for smooth integration without compromising the user experience. Cross-Regional Reach: The combined influence of LINE NEXT and Kaia across multiple Asian markets creates a powerful cross-regional network effect, accelerating Web3 adoption across different regions. \n\n By leveraging these strengths, LINE NEXT + Kaia are not merely participating in Web3 — they are laying the groundwork to transform it. Their combined strength has the potential to reshape how both developers and users interact with decentralized applications, driving Web3 adoption to new heights. \n\n## Strategic Benefits: User Experience and Developer Growth \n\n User convenience: Meeting Users Where They Are One of the biggest hurdles for Web2 users venturing into the world of Web3 is the complexity. From learning new concepts like cryptocurrencies and wallets to the need for upfront financial commitments such as funding accounts and paying gas fees, the entry barriers are high. This steep learning curve can be daunting, hindering the gradual adoption process that allows users to explore and eventually become value participants in the Web3 ecosystem. \n\n This is where mini Dapps on LINE truly shine, offering a frictionless experience that meets users exactly where they are. Unlike most crypto applications that require significant upfront financial commitment, mini Dapps are lightweight and easy to engage with, offering users a lowcommitment way to explore Web3 without needing to install separate apps or manage multiple steps. Social and consumer-based applications, which \n\n## Sign up to discover human stories that deepen your understanding of \n\n## the world. \n\n Free \n\n Distraction-free reading. No ads.

Find your audience. \n\n Membership \n\n Read member-only stories Support writers you read most Earn money for your writing Listen to audio narrations Read offline with the Medium app \n\n\n demand less from users in terms of commitment, tend to excel in these environments — and this is precisely what mini Dapps deliver. \n\n By integrating mini Dapps directly into the familiar LINE interface, users can access crypto services through the Dapp Portal without needing to download additional apps or set up wallets. With the built in social logins and in-app wallet, users bypass the often-confusing wallet setup process entirely. This makes interactions with Web3 seamless, intuitive, and hassle-free — allowing them to focus on the services they are using rather than the underlying blockchain technology. \n\n Kaia’s vision is to bring Web3 to the fingertips of millions, and the combination with LINE NEXT achieves just that. By allowing users to access Web3 services with just a few taps within an app they already use daily, psychological barriers to adoption are greatly reduced. There’s no need for users to make a big leap into an unfamiliar ecosystem — they can engage with mini Dapps naturally, just as they would with any other feature on LINE. This familiarity and ease of access makes LINE NEXT’s integration of Web3 services a true game-changer. \n\n Moreover, mobile-first design plays a pivotal role in this strategy. According to industry research, users spend 90% of their mobile time in apps, rather than mobile websites, highlighting the importance of mobile apps for frequent interaction and engagement. LINE, being inherently mobilefriendly, capitalizes on this trend. While many Web3 applications struggle to deliver a smooth mobile experience, mini Dapps on LINE are designed specifically for mobile users, allowing for frequent, casual interactions. This focus on mobile convenience makes it easier for users to engage with Web3 services on the go, without the need for specialized knowledge or downloads. \n\n The progression from Web2 to Web3 is gradual but powerful. Mini Dapps act as a gateway for users who may initially be unfamiliar with concepts like tokens, wallets, or transactions. Over time, as users interact with these \n\n## Sign up to discover human stories that deepen your understanding of \n\n## the world. \n\n Free \n\n Distraction-free reading. No ads.

Find your audience. \n\n Membership \n\n Read member-only stories Support writers you read most Earn money for your writing Listen to audio narrations Read offline with the Medium app \n\n\n features in simple, approachable ways, they become more comfortable and confident with the underlying technology. Armed with this newfound understanding, users are more likely to venture into advanced Web3 activities such as DeFi, NFT trading, etc. \n\n By meeting users where they are, mini Dapps on LINE lower the barriers to Web3 adoption, making the transition from Web2 to Web3 seamless and natural. This is the true essence of user convenience — empowering people to explore and interact with cutting-edge technologies without feeling overwhelmed. \n\n Dapp Distribution and Growth: Expanding Access, Lowering Barriers For new decentralized applications (Dapps), one of the most pressing challenges is discovery and user acquisition. Most Dapps, regardless of their potential, struggle to gain traction because the crypto world lacks organized, user-friendly platforms for discovering these applications. For everyday users who aren’t familiar with Web3, finding Dapps is like navigating a maze. Between specialized platforms and social networks, just discovering these apps is challenging, let alone using them. \n\n This challenge spans across all blockchain ecosystems. Even wellestablished platforms like Ethereum and Solana, despite their maturity and popularity, still struggle to provide effective distribution channels for new Dapps. While financial services such as DeFi platforms and exchanges have been able to prove their value through solid metrics like Total Value Locked (TVL) or trading volume, consumer-facing applications — especially newer ones — often face significant challenges in gaining visibility and reaching users. \n\n This is where Mini Dapps on LINE comes into play, offering a built-in discovery and distribution channel. By leveraging LINE’s massive user base of over 196 million monthly active users, developers no longer have to struggle with bootstrapping growth from scratch or depend solely on niche communities for visibility. Instead, they can plug into an ecosystem where \n\n## Sign up to discover human stories that deepen your understanding of \n\n## the world. \n\n Free \n\n Distraction-free reading. No ads.

Find your audience. \n\n Membership \n\n Read member-only stories Support writers you read most Earn money for your writing Listen to audio narrations Read offline with the Medium app \n\n\n users are already engaged, significantly simplifying Dapp discovery and usage — build mini, scale big. \n\n Finally, by harnessing the vast reach and existing infrastructure of LINE NEXT, combined with the decentralized power of Kaia blockchain, Mini Dapps provide an unprecedented opportunity for Dapp developers to overcome the historical challenges of discovery and growth. It’s an environment where users and developers both win: users enjoy effortless access to decentralized applications, while developers gain instant visibility and user feedback, fostering faster growth and adoption in the Web3 space. \n\n Sample image / source @LINE NEXT \n\n## Building Blocks of Mini Dapps on LINE \n\n Now that we’ve explored the concept of mini Dapps, let’s dive into the foundational components that power this exciting trend. These elements are the building blocks that developers can utilize to create seamless, userfriendly, Web3-enabled applications within the LINE ecosystem, enabling a smoother transition from Web2 to Web3 for millions of users. \n\n1. Dapp Portal     The Dapp Portal is a core service that simplifies access to mini Dapps     within LINE Messenger. It acts as a gateway, allowing users to connect     various Dapps to LINE without needing to download new apps or \n\n## Sign up to discover human stories that deepen your understanding of \n\n## the world. \n\n Free \n\n Distraction-free reading. No ads. Organize your knowledge with lists and highlights. Tell your story. Find your audience. \n\n Membership \n\n Read member-only stories Support writers you read most Earn money for your writing Listen to audio narrations Read offline with the Medium app \n\n\n navigate unfamiliar setups. This central hub lowers the technical barriers, making Web3 services more accessible to a wider audience. \n\n2. Mini Dapp SDK     The Mini Dapp SDK is a development toolkit that allows web-based Dapps     to be transformed into fully functional mini Dapps within LINE. By     leveraging LINE’s vast infrastructure, developers can harness this SDK to     connect with a massive audience. \n\n## Use Cases and Application \n\n Ok, what then can we build with mini Dapps? Below are some of the key areas where these Dapps can shine: \n\n Gaming and SocialFi Platforms: Developers can build interactive games that run inside LINE messenger, allowing users to play games while chatting with friends — enhancing social interaction through entertainment. Moreover, users can get access to various X2E (P2E, T2E, M2E) games, combining fun with financial incentives. NFT Marketplaces and Digital Collectibles: LINE Mini Dapp can act as platforms for buying, selling, or trading NFTs directly in chats, making it easier for users to engage with digital art and collectibles. \n\n And we can look forward to potential use cases and products that will build on these features to create additional LINE mini Dapps. \n\n Productivity and Accountability Platforms: Mini Dapps can also be tailored for productivity and accountability purposes. Users can set goals, create to-do lists, and track their progress directly in LINE, whether for personal development or team collaboration. Taking it a step further, goals can be validated through smart contracts, ensuring transparency and encouraging accountability. Social Networking and Community-Building Tools: LINE Mini Dapps can help organize group activities like event planning or polls directly within \n\n## Sign up to discover human stories that deepen your understanding of \n\n## the world. \n\n Free \n\n Distraction-free reading. No ads. Organize your knowledge with lists and highlights. Tell your story. Find your audience. \n\n Membership \n\n Read member-only stories Support writers you read most Earn money for your writing Listen to audio narrations Read offline with the Medium app \n\n\n chat groups. Community-focused mini apps can enhance social networking by making it easier for users to collaborate and participate in activities without ever leaving the messaging platform. \n\n## Conclusion and Future Outlook \n\n In summary, the collaboration between LINE NEXT and Kaia in creating access to mini Dapps signals a pivotal shift toward the rise of the Web3 super app. While crypto platforms today, such as exchanges or wallets, offer multifunctionalities, they remain limited to trading and isolated services. None have yet achieved the network effect or widespread accessibility of a life platform like LINE. \n\n This partnership represents a groundbreaking leap for the crypto ecosystem — one that is poised to deliver a scale and reach previously unseen. With LINE’s massive active user base of nearly 196 million monthly users, frictionless onboarding processes, and a robust distribution network through the Dapp Portal, mini Dapps on LINE have a distinct competitive advantage. \n\n While we are still in the early stages, the LINE NEXT and Kaia collaboration holds the potential to become the blueprint for the app-within-an-app model, not just in Asia but globally. By bridging Web2 and Web3 experiences seamlessly, they are laying the foundation for mass adoption of decentralized applications on an unprecedented scale. \n\n For builders eager to take part in this revolution, the Kaia Wave Program offers the ideal opportunity to develop and launch Mini Dapps within LINE Messenger. With access to LINE’s vast user base across Asia — including Japan, Taiwan, Thailand, and Indonesia — builders can rapidly grow and test their Dapps in real-world environments, accelerating both innovation and user adoption. \n\n Join the future of Web3 — explore the Kaia Wave Program today! \n\n## Sign up to discover human stories that deepen your understanding of \n\n## the world. \n\n Free \n\n Distraction-free reading.

    "# Notice of Point Adjustment for Kaia \n\n# Portal Epoch #1 \n\n Kaia Foundation · Follow Published in Kaia · 6 min read · Jan 7, 2025 \n\n Dear Kaia Portal users, \n\n Kaia Portal strives to enhance your experience within the Kaia ecosystem by rewarding consistent participation. \n\n As announced in our Kaia Portal Mission Reward Notice, we have analyzed data after Epoch #1 and resolved our external service integration issues. We are also implementing previously unapplied service policies by deducting \n\nOpen in app Sign up Sign in \n\n Search Write \n\n### Sign up to discover human stories that deepen your understanding of \n\n### the world. \n\n Free \n\n Distraction-free reading.

However, we have identified cases where some users provided liquidity in ways that did not align with the service’s original purpose, accumulating points without making substantial contributions to the Kaia DeFi ecosystem, thereby causing harm to other users. \n\n As already outlined in the Kaia Portal Docs Precautions, points obtained through abnormal methods other than “continuous liquidity provision” are subject to abuse classification. Accordingly, we have applied the following criteria to determine abuse and implement sanctions. \n\n Abuse Determination Criteria Abuse is defined as providing and immediately withdrawing liquidity around point accumulation times. Our determination considers both temporal aspects and continuity. We carefully reviewed the criteria to protect goodfaith users and excluded legitimate actions like momentary liquidity adjustments or mission changes from being classified as abuse. Following these criteria, we identified 23 accounts as abusive. \n\n Temporal Aspect: Providing liquidity only temporarily around hourly point updates to gain points is considered abuse. However, maintaining liquidity for most of the time period is acceptable, including actions like IL based rebalancing or mission protocol changes. Repetitive Aspect: Abuse is determined by temporary liquidity provision that occurs repeatedly over time. Single instances of temporary provision are not considered abuse. \n\n Abuse Penalty Details \n\n### Sign up to discover human stories that deepen your understanding of \n\n### the world. \n\n Free \n\n Distraction-free reading.

These adjustments were made after Epoch #1’s conclusion to ensure accurate data verification and proper impact assessment. \n\n Adjustments for External Service Integration Errors We have corrected incorrectly accumulated points in certain pools due to external service integration errors that occurred around October 12, 2024. Implementation of Kaia Portal v1.3 Policy Changes As announced in our previous notice, additional TVL obtained through Looping (recursive borrowing and lending) on Avalon Finance no longer earns points. We’ve now implemented this policy, which was temporarily delayed due to the gap between policy implementation (December 10, 2024, 00:00 KST) and system update (December 10, 2024, 15:00 KST). Point Deduction for Abuse Cases Based on our established criteria, we have deducted points from identified abusers and any points they generated. Final Referral Points Aggregation Individual users’ expected claim amounts should be calculated as follows: (Individual mission points + Individual referral points) / (Total mission points +Total referral points) However, due to the adjustment issues mentioned earlier, we haven’t been able to include total referral points in the calculation formula until now. This is because total referral points have undergone significant \n\n### Sign up to discover human stories that deepen your understanding of \n\n### the world. \n\n Free \n\n Distraction-free reading.

However, as point adjustments have been finalized for this claim, each individual’s claim amount will be determined by incorporating the total referral points. As a result, we would like to inform you in advance that the actual claim amounts may be approximately 3% lower on average than the expected claim amounts. \n\n Following these adjustments, we will distribute 15M KAIA to the General Pool and 22.5M KAIA to the FGP-23 voter’s Pool based on the final adjusted point totals. \n\n### Reminder of FNSA Long-term Holder Rewards \n\n Existing FNSA long-term holders will receive their Epoch #1 rewards plus an additional 10 million KAIA as outlined in the KAIA On-chain Contributor Reward Distribution Criteria. \n\n For details about reward methods and frequency, please refer to our previous announcement.

( 개인 미션 포인트 + 개인 레퍼럴 포인트) / ( 전체 미션 포인트 + 전체 레퍼럴 포인트 ) 하지만, 앞서 언급한 조정 이슈로 인해 이제까지 계산식에서 전체 레퍼럴 포인트 를 포 함하지 못했습니다. 전체 레퍼럴 포인트는 개인 포인트의 조정분 및 어뷰징 포인트 차 감 결과에 따라 큰 변동이 있어 예상 Claim 수량 계산에 이를 반영하지 못했기 때문입 니다. 하지만, 이번 Claim에는 포인트 조정이 마무리 되어 전체 레퍼럴 포인트를 반영 해 각 개인의 Claim 수량이 결정됩니다. 이에 따라 전반적으로 실제 Claim 양이 예상 Claim 양보다 평균적으로 -3% 정도 작아질 수 있음을 미리 공유드립니다. \n\n### Sign up to discover human stories that deepen your understanding of \n\n### the world. \n\n Free \n\n Distraction-free reading.

We respect builders and users alike, and we want to build an ecosystem where everyone can grow together. In this article, we aim to summarize the recent issues that have arisen within the community regarding the Kaiaswap team and to clarify the official position of the Kaia Foundation. \n\n## 1.

Kaiaswap’s recent issues \n\n As for the delay in the Foundation’s official response, we were made aware of the issue by the community, and it took quite a while for the Foundation to understand the issues raised by the Kaiaswap team and the community, and to balance the differences between the two sides’ perceptions and how they communicated about the issue. \n\n There are two main issues raised by the community: \n\n1. Trading Competition Winnings Mainly Received by partners with Self-     Rotating Trading \n\n2. Unusual v3 scope and reward monopoly farming in KLAY-MBTC \n\n## Sign up to discover human stories that deepen your understanding of \n\n## the world. \n\n Free \n\n Distraction-free reading. No ads.

Find your audience. \n\n Membership \n\n Read member-only stories Support writers you read most Earn money for your writing Listen to audio narrations Read offline with the Medium app \n\n\n Differing perspectives on issues @Kaia Foundation \n\n As the operator of the D2I program and a contracting party, the foundation has reviewed potential issues in the actions of Kaiaswap, including the aforementioned concerns. \n\n1. Are there any violations of the D2I Agreement?     a) Issues 1 and 2 do not work against the goal of increasing trading     volume and raising TVL.     b) The wording of the Grant Agreement, “ If the Grant Tokens are used in     an abusive or improper manner” could be argued against. \n\n- Lending to partners to participate in trading competitions could be considered an improper use of the Grant. The use of NFTs to move tokens or volume to exchanges may also be considered methodologically inappropriate. \n\n2. Did the Kaiaswap team engage in behavior that directly benefited them?     a) KaiaSwap team has not taken liquidity incentives and trading rewards     beyond public rules and campaigns, according to their statement and     provided proof of blockchain transactions.     b) Even though it was an open competition, it is problematic that the     professional trading firms and liquidity providers received more prize \n\n## Sign up to discover human stories that deepen your understanding of \n\n## the world. \n\n Free \n\n Distraction-free reading. No ads. Organize your knowledge with lists and highlights. Tell your story. Find your audience. \n\n Membership \n\n Read member-only stories Support writers you read most Earn money for your writing Listen to audio narrations Read offline with the Medium app \n\n\n money than retail users from the competition. The promotion was not designed in a way that would be accepted by a large number of retail users. \n\n3. Did the action follow the direction of the D2I? Did it follow the D2I     guidelines well?     a) Allowing professional trades and liquidity providers to profit from self-     rotating trades does not seem to be beneficial to Kaia’s DeFi ecosystem,     even if it is to increase trading volume. As proof of this, the volume of     trading on Kaiaswap decreased significantly after the event. Therefore, it     is difficult to conclude that the trading competition actually produced     lasting results.     b) Incentivizing unused liquidity is a way of farming incentives while     lowering risk, i.e., bringing in MBTC and increasing TVL, which is not     easily acceptable when compared to other V3-style DEXes. It’s hard to see     this as a way to help Kaia’s DeFi in the long run.     c) The intention of the grant is to revitalize the ecosystem. KaiaSwap’s     campaigns seem to be more beneficial to a few, where changes need to     be made. \n\n4. Was it nonetheless a helpful behavior for Kaia?     a) While it may be beneficial in terms of quantitative data such as TVL     and transaction volume, it is difficult to evaluate the reasonableness of     continuing the promotion through D2I resources, which are publicly     funded.     b) Especially, some questions proposed by some community members     were not answered accurately to end the suspicion. This is a limitation on     the continued use of ecosystem resources. \n\n## 3. The Foundation’s stance and what’s next \n\n In accordance with the above recognition, the Foundation has made the following decisions regarding Kaiaswap and will be amending the contract. \n\n1. For the Liquidity Incentive Grant, the remaining amount is freezed     before any new campaigns should be carried on. Liquidity Mining shall \n\n## Sign up to discover human stories that deepen your understanding of \n\n## the world. \n\n Free \n\n Distraction-free reading. No ads.

Liquidity Provision Grant shall be redeemed. However, the optimal     timing will be discussed again considering impermanent loss. \n\n3. This is the end of support for D2I, but we will continue to work with the     Kaiaswap team. \n\n Termination of D2I contracts The Kaia Foundation will terminate the current D2I grant agreement and discontinue utilizing the D2I grant for Kaiaswap. The Kaiaswap team will return unused Liquidity Incentives and liquidity provision grant to Kaia’s treasury upon the termination of the D2I grant agreement. The Kaiaswap team and the Kaia Foundation will discuss when we can terminate the D2I grant agreement and any follow-up items related to the termination. Since there could be impermanent loss (IL) if we withdraw liquidity from Kaiaswap, the Kaiaswap team and the Kaia Foundation will discuss further about whether the liquidity must be withdrawn and if so when it is the best time to withdraw the liquidity. \n\n Future contribution plans agreed upon with the Kaiaswap team Regardless of the D2I grant, the Kaiaswap team will continue to build Kaiaswap on Kaia and contribute to the growth of the Kaia ecosystem. \n\n Kaiaswap will buy back more KAIA (KLAY) tokens using Kaiaswap’s revenue until the end of this year. If Kaiaswap issues its token in the future, the Kaiaswap team will allocate more tokens for the community to increase the community’s engagement. The Kaiaswap team will continue building on Kaia with new narratives, including mini Dapp initiatives on both Kaia and LINE. \n\n## Sign up to discover human stories that deepen your understanding of \n\n## the world. \n\n Free \n\n Distraction-free reading.

    "# Preparations for the Upcoming Kaia \n\n# Chain Token Swap \n\n#### Kaia Foundation · Follow \n\n Published in Kaia · 5 min read · Jul 15, 2024 \n\n##### 1 \n\n### *Note: All dates and details are preliminary and are subject to change, and \n\n### we will provide final details as we approach Kaia chain’s launch. \n\n### In January, we proposed the chain merge of Klaytn and Finschia and are \n\n### currently working on the launch of Kaia. We are working to create a \n\n### technical infrastructure that combines the best of both Finschia and Klaytn, \n\n### aiming for an end-of-August launch \n\nOpen in app Sign up Sign in \n\n Search Write \n\n## Sign up to discover human stories that deepen your understanding of \n\n## the world. \n\n#### Free \n\n Distraction-free reading.

Therefore, \n\n### KLAY holders will not need to perform a separate token swap, but FNSA \n\n### holders will need to swap to KAIA tokens. The token swap will be available \n\n### through the Kaia Portal, built by the Kaia Foundation and available at the \n\n### same time as the Kaia Chain launch. In this guide, you’ll learn how to swap \n\n### FNSA tokens on the Finschia chain for KAIA tokens on the Kaia chain ahead \n\n### of the new chain launch. \n\n### Prerequisites \n\n### For the purposes of this guide, “swap” refers to the ability to swap FNSA on \n\n### the Finschia chain for KAIA tokens on the Kaia chain. Once the swap is \n\n### completed on Finschia, the KAIA tokens will be transferred to the Kaia chain \n\n### via a bridge provided by the Kaia Portal. While the process involves both \n\n### chains, the Kaia Portal simplifies performing all swaps on a single webpage. \n\n### In order to perform the swap functions below, you will need an account on \n\n### the upcoming Kaia chain, and the swap will require a Finschia wallet. The \n\n### supported wallet types are as follows: \n\n### *Note: The wallet types below are the types of Finschia wallets supported \n\n### during the token swap process, and the Kaia Portal will also support Klaytn’s \n\n### existing representative wallets. \n\n### Keplr \n\n### DOSI Vault extension & mobile app \n\n### Neopin \n\n### Cosmostation \n\n### Token Swap Steps \n\n## Sign up to discover human stories that deepen your understanding of \n\n## the world. \n\n#### Free \n\n Distraction-free reading.

Access the Kaia Portal. \n\n### 2. Connect the wallet that holds your FNSA. \n\n### 3. Enter the address of the recipient account on the Kaia mainnet where \n\n### you want to store your KAIA tokens. \n\n- We recommend that you pre-set the wallet to receive KAIA token by \n\n### referring to the supported wallets listed in this guide. \n\n### 4. Enter the quantity of FNSA to be swapped. \n\n- Once the swap is complete, it is irreversible. We recommend that you \n\n### confirm and enter the correct quantity. \n\n### 5. Request the swap. \n\n- There is a waiting period before the swap is finalized. This is to allow \n\n### time to react in case of unusual circumstances. A latency of a few tens of \n\n### minutes is expected. \n\n- Once the waiting period is complete, you will be able to claim KAIA \n\n### tokens from the Kaia chain. Claims are executed automatically, so you \n\n### don’t need to prepare transaction costs in advance for your Kaia Chain \n\n### account. \n\n## Sign up to discover human stories that deepen your understanding of \n\n## the world. \n\n#### Free \n\n Distraction-free reading.

The tokens issued to that contract can only be unlocked through the \n\n### FNSA -> KAIA swap process and cannot be transferred arbitrarily by anyone, \n\n### including the Foundation. As each user performs the FNSA -> KAIA swap, a \n\n### small amount of the locked supply is released. \n\n### During the transition from FNSA to KAIA, the Finschia chain will see \n\n### approximately 148 times the quantity change. This process creates tokens on \n\n### the Finschia chain that are temporarily equal in value to KAIA, which only \n\n### exist temporarily and are burned when a bridge makes an unlock request to \n\n### the Kaia chain. Requests on the bridge are only one-way from the Finschia \n\n## Sign up to discover human stories that deepen your understanding of \n\n## the world. \n\n#### Free \n\n Distraction-free reading.

During this process, the KAIA tokens are temporarily locked on the \n\n### bridge, and if the check completes successfully, they are moved to the user’s \n\n### designated wallet on the Kaia chain. \n\n### FAQ \n\n### Is Kaia Portal secure? \n\n### Kaia Portal is official infrastructure provided by the Kaia Foundation. \n\n### The Finschia Foundation and Klaytn are conducting joint development \n\n### and testing over the coming months to provide a stable and complete \n\n### swap service. We will also work with a reputable audit firm to ensure the \n\n### service’s reliability before its official launch. \n\n### When will swaps be available? \n\n### The FNSA to KAIA token swap feature will be available at the same time \n\n### as the Kaia Portal launch. The Kaia Portal will go live with the mainnet \n\n### launch in late August, with more details to follow. \n\n### Will the swap process incur gas fees? \n\n### We understand that some gas fees are necessary for the stable operation \n\n### of the chain, especially when a lot of funds are being transferred, such as \n\n### the swap function described in this guide, but we hope you understand \n\n### that gas fees are a minimum security factor for stability. \n\n### Do I need to pay any additional service fees? \n\n### When Finschia Chain users swap tokens using the Kaia Foundation’s \n\n### official bridge, there are no additional service fees other than a small gas \n\n### fee for the token conversion request. \n\n## Sign up to discover human stories that deepen your understanding of \n\n## the world. \n\n#### Free \n\n Distraction-free reading.

To this end, \n\n### we may introduce a minimum default transfer delay. \n\n### In this case, users will receive KAIA token after that time has elapsed \n\n### when executing a swap. Other detailed operational policies will be \n\n### announced at a later date. \n\n### Can I use KAIA token on the Finschia mainnet? \n\n### In principle, KAIA is only distributed on the Kaia Mainnet. We will \n\n### announce the use of KAIA token on the Finschia Mainnet at a later date. \n\n### Swap Service Operators \n\n### We recommend that you only run swaps through the Kaia Portal, which is \n\n### officially provided by the Kaia Foundation. Please note that the \n\n### Foundation is not responsible for any other methods used. \n\n### How is the swap process carried out if I hold FNSA tokens on an \n\n### exchange? \n\n### If you hold FNSA tokens on an exchange, the swap schedule and \n\n### availability may vary according to each exchange’s policies. Therefore, if \n\n### a specific exchange does not support the swap, the foundation will \n\n### coordinate with the exchange to cease pre-trade support for FNSA and \n\n### ensure that asset withdrawals are possible to protect user assets. \n\n### Thus, users holding FNSA on an exchange should carefully check the \n\n### exchange’s announcements and, if necessary, withdraw their assets and \n\n### proceed with the swap directly through the Kaia Portal. \n\n English Kaia Chain Blockchain Cryptocurrency \n\n## Sign up to discover human stories that deepen your understanding of \n\n## the world. \n\n#### Free \n\n Distraction-free reading.

    "# Project Dragon: Responding to \n\n# Institutional Demand \n\n Kaia Foundation · Follow Published in Kaia · 8 min read · Jul 10, 2024 \n\n Note On January 16, Klaytn Foundation and Finschia Foundation proposed to merge our technology, user bases, and resources to build the largest blockchain in Asia. This post is part of a series of communications to help both our communities understand our strategy and intent behind the merge proposal, in order to facilitate informed discussions that we will be actively listening to leading up to the governance vote. \n\nOpen in app Sign up Sign in \n\n Search Write \n\n## Sign up to discover human stories that deepen your understanding of \n\n## the world. \n\n Free \n\n Distraction-free reading.

Please note that the contents of this post are based on current data and insights, and may be subject to change based on the evolving industry landscape. \n\n## The growing institutional demand for crypto \n\n The recent approval of the Bitcoin Spot ETF, a hot topic in the industry, was a long-awaited event for crypto as a whole, as many products have previously been denied approval due to legal risks and possible market corrections. This is a strong indication that the way the institutional market views crypto is changing.In response, the industry is moving quickly, with institutions such as Blackrock having already filed for a spot Ethereum ETF filing. \n\n Beyond these ETF products, institutional investors are increasingly interested in cryptocurrencies as a whole. According to Coinbase’s latest survey (November 2023), 45% of institutional investors believe they will increase their allocation to cryptocurrencies in the next three years, and 57% believe the price of cryptocurrencies will increase in the next 12 months — a stark contrast to the signals from the 2022 survey, when only 8% of institutional investors were positive about cryptocurrencies. Beyond cryptocurrencies as an investment, respondents are generally also optimistic \n\n## Sign up to discover human stories that deepen your understanding of \n\n## the world. \n\n Free \n\n Distraction-free reading.

However, responding to this institutional demand is not just about listing on exchanges, but also about the performance of the project itself, as well as the chain’s sense of scale, brand, infrastructure, and internal systems. \n\n In the next section, we will highlight what institutional investors are looking for, what Project Dragon is prepared for, and what strengths we will have once merged that will help Project Dragon respond to this institutional demand. \n\n## Meeting institutional investor requirements through our \n\n## combined strengths \n\n## Sign up to discover human stories that deepen your understanding of \n\n## the world. \n\n Free \n\n Distraction-free reading.

In addition, we plan to pursue roadmaps that will strengthen the fundamentals and prospects of the project itself, such as discovering AI DApp categories, onboarding Asian SSS game companies, and large-scale onchainization of Web2 assets. \n\n In terms of strengthening these fundamentals, we are already in active discussions with several stablecoin issuers to onboard their native stablecoins onto Project Dragon. These native stablecoins typically have higher liquidity and market capitalization thresholds which the merged chain will be able to fulfil. \n\n From a branding perspective, Project Dragon’s unique strength of being integrated with Kakaotalk and LINE messenger, two of Asia’s most popular messaging apps, gives us an immediate advantage in attracting the attention of traditional institutional investors who may value our close business relationships with Kakao and LINE. Additionally, Klaytn and Finschia have \n\n## Sign up to discover human stories that deepen your understanding of \n\n## the world. \n\n Free \n\n Distraction-free reading. No ads.

For example, any grant programs will be operated transparently from application to post-evaluation to ensure that the grant funds are being utilized responsibly.. \n\n In addition to transparency, decentralization is also an important factor, especially since traditional U.S. institutional investors currently do not invest in cryptocurrencies if they have security characteristics. Therefore, decentralization is not only necessary for the continued development and security of the protocol itself, but also an essential milestone for Project Dragon in its institutionalization process. \n\n With the chain merge, Project Dragon will gain increased governance decentralization by virtue of a larger governance body and decentralization of voting rights, as well as increased technical decentralization from having a larger number of conensus nodes and endpoints. \n\n In addition to this, Project Dragon will continue to pursue the direction of becoming permissionless and politically decentralized. By allowing anyone to participate as a consensus node with a minimum stake, the number of validator nodes will sharply increase. Additionally, anyone will also be able to freely delegate their tokens to validators to participate in governance. \n\n## Sign up to discover human stories that deepen your understanding of \n\n## the world. \n\n Free \n\n Distraction-free reading.

As an example, to get into the S&P Cryptocurrency LargeCap Index, a digital asset needs to meet the following criteria: \n\n Market capitalization: A digital asset must have a market capitalization of at least US$1 billion. “Market capitalization” is defined as the “effective coin supply” multiplied by the coin price. Liquidity: Must have a three-month MDVT (median daily trading value) of at least US$1 million. At the discretion of the Index Committee, shorter periods of MDVT may be allowed. \n\n There are several other criteria required by other indexes such as the Bloomberg Galaxy Crypto Index, but the most important ones are as follows \n\n Be in the top 25 overall by market capitalization. The asset’s market capitalization (relative to the combined market capitalization of the top 25 assets) must be at least 1%. \n\n Based on these criteria, 12 cryptocurrencies are currently included, ranging from Bitcoin to XLM (Stellar, $3.2 Billion). Several other indexes exist, including the Nasdaq Crypto Index and the MarketVector Digital Assets Index, with the commonality that they are composed primarily of the highest market capitalization crypto assets. With a market capitalization of around $900M at the time of integration and the combined liquidity of both chains, Project Dragon will be able to meet these criteria faster than before. \n\n In addition, the trading prices and liquidity of these indices are mostly provided by data providers that they trust, and in the case of data providers, a few global exchanges are the standard for pricing and liquidity.

For Project Dragon, we plan to collaborate and list on fiat onand off-ramp exchanges that are accessible to institutional investors, including those already listed, which is expected to be easier than doing so individually as two separate chains. \n\n Investment and information infrastructure, including Custody \n\n As you can see from the figures above, the infrastructure required by institutional investors is not just limited to crypto exchanges. Since it is very difficult for institutional investors to store and manage cryptocurrencies themselves, they primarily use custodians to store their cryptocurrencies. In fact, since the approval of the ETF, we have seen new custodians obtain various security and audit licenses (ISO, SOC, etc.) in order to meet the demands and high standards of institutional investors. Therefore, being on the list of custodians is very important to attract institutional investments. \n\n They also need a brokerage that can do this for them, as they often buy and sell in large quantities, and many of their trades are done through intermediaries. Finally, there will need to be steps taken to allow cryptocurrencies to be purchased within the existing financial infrastructure, such as via the Bitcoin ETFs that we see today. \n\n Project Dragon intends to start with custody and brokerage, and gradually build out the related infrastructure. For custodians, in addition to the S&P Cryptocurrency Index mentioned above, it’s important to have an integrated chain of trusted global custodians, such as Bitwise and BlackRock, among many others. We will be working with integrated trusted custodians and brokerages, prioritizing regions where there is demand first. \n\n## Sign up to discover human stories that deepen your understanding of \n\n## the world. \n\n Free \n\n Distraction-free reading.

Therefore, the larger and more recognizable the project, the more favorable it is to negotiate and integrate, and in this respect, naturally, Project Dragon will be in a much stronger position. \n\n As big players in the market, institutional investors are only interested in the key players of the industry. As Asia’s largest blockchain ecosystem, Project Dragon will have an overwhelming advantage in terms of growth, branding, decentralization, infrastructure support, and integration, giving us the capability to capture the coming wave of institutional investor participation. \n\n Published in Kaia 209 Followers · Last published 2 days ago Kaia is a high performance public blockchain that simplifies Web3 for users, builders, investors, enterprises, and everyone in-between. \n\n Follow \n\n Written by Kaia Foundation 287 Followers · 5 Following \n\n Follow \n\n English Kaia Chain Blockchain Cryptocurrency \n\n## Sign up to discover human stories that deepen your understanding of \n\n## the world. \n\n Free \n\n Distraction-free reading.

All parties agreed that an extension to the current \n\n### voting period will facilitate further constructive dialogue for both Klaytn and \n\n### Finschia communities required by governance participants in order to make \n\n### an informed decision. \n\n### The decision was made during an ad hoc convening of GC members to \n\n### discuss the KGP-25 voting period.

A significant percentage of both Klaytn and Finschia user communities \n\n### have provided continuous feedback highlighting the lack of granularity \n\n### and adequate answers considering the scope of the proposal and \n\n### potential future impact, and believe the current 7 day voting period is not \n\n### long enough to be able to make an informed decision. \n\n### 2. Several members of Klaytn and Finschia’s governance organizations have \n\n### also voiced their concerns regarding the level of details provided prior to \n\n### and during voting, highlighting the need for deeper due diligence. \n\n### 3. An addendum addressing community feedback was added to the initial \n\n### proposal on the evening of Jan 25th (Thurs) KST, and since then, we have \n\n### received comments that the voting period should have been extended \n\n### considering limited time that was available to review the updates made to \n\n### the original proposal. \n\n## Sign up to discover human stories that deepen your understanding of \n\n## the world. \n\n#### Free \n\n Distraction-free reading.

We are well on our way to implementing the DeFi \n\n### initiative for Kaia Chain, with various ecosystem partners onboarded. We \n\n### previously announced that Dragonswap, iZUMi and Wombat were the first \n\n### DEXs to be selected for the D2I program. In this article, we’ll round up the \n\n### latest news from these teams. \n\n### KaiaSwap, a secure and efficient DEX service for high-performance chains \n\n### Powered by technology from iZUMi Finance, a leader in decentralized \n\n### finance with a focus on innovative technology and user experience, \n\n### KaiaSwap is Kaia Chain’s first native DLAMM (Discretized-Liquidity-AMM) \n\n### DEX, which leverages the advantages of the AMM model design to achieve \n\n### high capital efficiency by concentrating liquidity at specific price points. It \n\n### will bring transparency, security, and an efficient on-chain experience to the \n\n### sustainable and verifiable Kaia Chain ecosystem. \n\n### In particular, iZUMi’s unique solution, DEX-as-a-Service, will combine \n\n### DLAMM, Account Abstraction, and Multi-sig capabilities to provide a safer \n\n### and more accessible DEX service based on low gas fees on the high\n\n### performance Kaia Chain. \n\n### Capybara, a new DEX with a user-friendly Launchpad \n\n### Capybara, powered by Wombat, a multi-chain stable swap protocol, is a new \n\n### DEX that combines a gamified point system, launchpad, and airdrop \n\n### playground on the Kaia chain. The Capybara Launchpad is the first \n\n### launchpad on the Kaia chain, and will serve as a direct connection between \n\n### the Kaia chain and global users. \n\n### Specifically, Capybara removes barriers to scalability by innovating a \n\n### coverage ratio-based stable swap mechanism, allowing Kaia ecosystem \n\n### participants to leverage capital without impermanent losses.

All \n\n### of this is backed by a user-friendly UX/UI, and with a full launch with the \n\n### $CAPY token coming soon, we expect to see the Kaia ecosystem come to life. \n\n### Ecosystem synergy matters \n\n### Meanwhile, the synergy requires easy access to on-chain data and analytical \n\n### tools to create a broader ecosystem. In this regard, the integration of Kaia \n\n### Chain and Flipside, which will be voted on by the Governance Council in \n\n### May, is expected to be a major boost to this ecosystem synergy. \n\n### Flipside is a platform that provides trusted and comprehensive blockchain \n\n### data, analyzes blockchain data with Snowflake SQL, and provides \n\n### dashboards to generate visualizations. Once this Flipside to Kaia Chain \n\n### integration is complete, you will be able to dashboard expertly modeled data \n\n### for every decentralized finance transaction on the Kaia Chain. For example, \n\n### DEXs on Kaia Chain will be able to provide seamless access to core data such \n\n### as blocks, events, and transactions, as well as on-chain DeFi activities such as \n\n### swaps and staking. \n\n### Our partnership with Wombat, iZUMi and Flipside is all a part of Kaia \n\n### Foundation’s D2I program and facilitating synergies across all DeFi money \n\n### lego’s and infrastructure is a key goal in order to reach maximum \n\n### optimization of liquidity across the entire Kaia ecosystem. The Kaia \n\n### Foundation will continue onboarding more DeFi partners to create more \n\n### liquidity synergies between existing protocols, with the goal of building the \n\n### most liquid on-chain experience in crypto. \n\n### Kaia’s D2I program will focus on launching DApps in various areas of DeFi, \n\n### building a strong financial infrastructure for their synergies, and supporting \n\n### more DApps and builders. We look forward to seeing what KaiaSwap, \n\n### Capybara, and Flipside will do in the future and the synergies between them. \n\n## Sign up to discover human stories that deepen your understanding of \n\n## the world. \n\n#### Free \n\n Distraction-free reading.

    " About Kaia Nodes \n\n# About Kaia Nodes \n\nThe Kaia network is comprised of three types of nodes: \n\n Consensus Node (CN): CNs are responsible for validating transactions and producing new blocks. Proxy Node (PN): PNs relay transactions between CNs and ENs. Endpoint Node (EN): ENs provide public access to the Kaia network. \n\nTo participate in consensus and governance, you are required to run a CN. CNs must meet certain hardware and software requirements, and they must stake KAIA tokens. \n\nYou can also run a PN or EN to support the Kaia network. PNs and ENs do not require staking, but they do require some technical expertise and resources. \n\nThis section provides all the necessary information to set up and operate an Endpoint Node, and \n\ncontribute to the Kaia network or configure and run a Consensus Node to participation in Kaia’s network governance. \n\nEdit this page Last updated on **Jan 24, 2025** \n\n Make this page better \n\n\n",

    " Core Concepts Accounts \n\n# Accounts \n\n## Kaia Accounts \n\n### Overview of Account, State, and Address \n\nAn account in Kaia is a data structure containing information about a person’s balance or a smart contract. Kaia’s state is the collection of all its accounts' states that is, the past and current state of all data stored across Kaia’s accounts. When a transaction is executed on a Kaia node, the state of Kaia consequently changes across all its nodes. The state should be the same across all nodes in the Kaia network if they have processed the same blocks in the same order. State information of each account is associated with a 20-byte address, which is used to identify each account. \n\n### Decoupling Key Pairs From Addresses \n\nAn account in a typical blockchain platform is associated with a cryptographically processed address of a certain length that usually looks like this: \"0x0fe2e20716753082222b52e753854f40afddffd2\". This address is strongly coupled with a key pair. If a key pair is chosen, the address is derived from the public key. This has many disadvantages in terms of user experience. Some of them are the following: \n\n It is impossible for users to have addresses they want. It is impossible for users to use multiple key pairs to increase security of their accounts. It is impossible for users to change the account’s key pair when the private key is accidentally exposed or when users want to update the private key periodically to increase the account’s security. \n\nThose are big hurdles that users cannot think of an address as an identifier in the blockchain platform. To clear this hurdle, Kaia provides a feature that users can choose their addresses and key pairs. With this feature, users can choose addresses that they want and they can use multiple key pairs to increase security. The number of key pairs can be one or more, and the key pairs can have different roles. For details of multiple key pairs or role-based keys, please refer to Multiple Key Pairs & Role-Based Keys. \n\nIt is worth noting that Kaia also supports the old scheme that a key pair and an address are strongly coupled. \n\n### Multiple Key Pairs and Role-Based Keys \n\n Make this page better \n\n\nAs described before, when the private key is stolen, exposed, or somehow compromised, there is nothing to do to restore the account’s security: the best option is to generate another key pair to create a new account, and migrate the balance from the old compromised account to the new one. Lack of support for advanced key schemes such as multi-sig or usage-specific key is yet another source of major inconvenience. To address those problems more efficiently, Kaia accounts provide the following capabilities: \n\n Kaia account allows the key pair associated with the account to be changed. Kaia account supports multiple key pairs, along with the ability to assign each key with different purpose. Kaia account maintains compatibility with accounts having a single key that is strongly coupled with the address. \n\nBy utilizing Kaia account’s role-based multi-key support, end-users can better handle real-life security risk situations such as private key mismanagement. For example, when a user realizes that his or her private key has been exposed, the user can simply replace the compromised private key by removing the exposed key pair from his or her account and creating a new key pair to replace them. This could be achieved by using a dedicated key used for updating account information, created in advance and stored separately from the compromised private key. \n\n### Kaia Wallet Key Format \n\nKaia wallet key format is provided to easily handle a private key along with the corresponding address. It makes easier for a user to maintain his/her private key with an address. The format is 0x{private key}0x{type}0x{address in hex} in hexadecimal notation, where {type} must be 00. Other values are reserved. An example is shown below: \n\n### Kaia Account Types \n\nThere are two types of accounts in Kaia: externally owned accounts (EOAs), and smart contract accounts (SCAs). \n\n**Externally Owned Accounts (EOAs)** \n\nExternally owned accounts have information such as nonce and balance. This type of accounts does not have code or storage. EOAs are controlled by private keys and do not have code associated with them. An EOA can be created using key pairs and subsequently controlled by anyone with the key pairs. The account key is described in the section Account Key. \n\n**Attributes** \n\n 0x45a915e4d060149eb4365960e6a7a45f334393093061116b197e3240065ff2d80x000xa94f5374fce5edbc8 \n\n Make^ this^ page^ better \n\n\n Attribute Type Description \n\n type uint8 (Go) The type of externally owned accounts. It must be 0x1 for EOAs. \n\n nonce uint64 (Go) \n\n A sequence number used to determine the order of transactions. The transaction to be processed next has the same nonce with this value. \n\n balance *big.Int (Go) The amount of KAIA the account has. \n\n humanReadable bool (Go) \n\n A boolean value indicating that the account is associated with a human-readable address. Since HRA (human-readable address) is not supported yet, this value is false for all accounts. \n\n key AccountKey \n\n The key associated with this account. This field can be any of AccountKeyLegacy, AccountKeyPublic, AccountKeyFail, AccountKeyWeightedMultisig, AccountKeyRoleBased. Signatures in transactions are verified with this key. \n\n**Smart Contract Accounts (SCAs)** \n\nIn contrast to EOAs, SCAs have code associated with them and are controlled by their code. SCAs are created by smart contract deployment transactions; once deployed, an SCA cannot initiate new transactions by itself and must be triggered by another account, either by an EOA or another SCA. \n\n**Attributes** \n\n Attribute Type Description \n\n type uint8 (Go) The type of smart contract accounts. It must be 0x2 for SCAs. \n\n nonce uint64 (Go) \n\n A sequence number used to determine the order of transactions. The transaction to be processed next has the same nonce with this value. \n\n balance *big.Int (Go) The amount of KAIA the account has. \n\n humanReadable bool (Go) \n\n A boolean value indicating that the account is associated with a human-readable address. Since HRA (human-readable address) is not supported yet, this value is false for all accounts. Make this page better \n\n\n Attribute Type Description \n\n key AccountKey \n\n The key associated with this account. This field can be any of AccountKeyLegacy, AccountKeyPublic, AccountKeyFail, AccountKeyWeightedMultisig, AccountKeyRoleBased. Signatures in transactions are verified with this key. \n\n codeHash []byte (Go) \n\n The hash of the account’s smart contract code. This value is immutable, which means it is set only when the smart contract is created. \n\n storageRoot [32]byte (Go) \n\n A 256-bit hash of the root of the Merkle Patricia Trie that contains the values of all the storage variables in the account. \n\n codeFormat uint8 (Go) \n\n Supporting interpreter version. Up to 16 can be set. Currently, it supports EVM(0x00) only. \n\n vmVersion uint8 (Go) \n\n The protocol upgrade (hard fork) information at contract deployment time (ex. 0x0(constantinople), 0x1(istanbul,london,...)). Up to 16 can be used. It is automatically created with the contract. \n\n NOTE NOTE: From kaia v1.7.0 onwards, vmVersion attribute will be added to the Smart Contract Account. \n\n### Kaia Account Type ID \n\nBelow are the Account Type ID assigned to each Account Type. \n\n Account Type Account Type ID \n\n Externally Owned Account (EOA) 0x1 \n\n Smart Contract Account (SCA) 0x2 \n\n## Account Key \n\nAn account key represents the key structure associated with an account. Make this page better \n\n\n### AccountKeyNil \n\nAccountKeyNil represents an empty key. If an account tries to have an AccountKeyNil object, the transaction will be failed. AccountKeyNil is used only for TxTypeAccountUpdate transactions with rolebased keys. For example, if an account tries to update RoleAccountUpdate key only, the key field of the TxTypeAccountUpdate transaction would be: \n\n [AccountKeyNil, NewKey, AccountKeyNil] \n\nThen, only the RoleAccountUpdate key is updated. Other roles are not updated. Refer to the AccountKeyRoleBased for more detail. \n\n**Attributes** \n\nNo attributes for AccountKeyNil. \n\n**RLP Encoding** \n\n 0x80 \n\n### AccountKeyLegacy \n\nAccountKeyLegacy is used for the account having an address derived from the corresponding key pair. If an account has AccountKeyLegacy, the transaction validation process is done like below (as typical Blockchain platforms did): \n\n Get the public key from ecrecover(txhash, txsig). Get the address of the public key. The address is the sender. \n\n**Attributes** \n\n Attribute Type Description \n\n Type uint8 (Go) The type of AccountKeyLegacy. This must be 0x01. \n\n**RLP Encoding** \n\n 0x01c0 \n\n### AccountKeyPublic \n\nAccountKeyPublic is used for accounts having one public key. If an account has an AccountKeyPublic object, the transaction validation process is done like below: \n\n Make this page better \n\n\nGet the public key derived from (^) ecrecover(txhash, txsig). Check that the derived public key is the same as the corresponding account’s public key. **Attributes Attribute Type Description** Type uint8 (Go) The type of AccountKeyPublic. This must be **0x02**. Key [33]byte (Go) Key should be a compressed public key on S256 curve. **RLP Encoding** 0x02 + encode(CompressedPubKey) **NOTE** : CompressedPubKey is a public key in a compressed format defined in SEC1. In short, 0x02 {PubkeyX} if PubkeyY is an even number or 0x03 {PubkeyX} otherwise. **RLP Encoding (Example)** \n\n### AccountKeyFail \n\nIf an account has the key AccountKeyFail, the transaction validation process always fails. It can be used for smart contract accounts so that a transaction sent from the smart contract account always fails. \n\n**Attributes** \n\n Attribute Type Description \n\n Type uint8 (Go) The type of AcccountKeyFail. It must be 0x03. \n\n**RLP Encoding** \n\n 0x03c0 \n\n prvkey 0xf8cc7c3813ad23817466b1802ee805ee417001fcce9376ab8728c92dd8ea0a6b pubkeyX 0xdbac81e8486d68eac4e6ef9db617f7fbd79a04a3b323c982a09cdfc61f0ae0e8 pubkeyY 0x906d7170ba349c86879fb8006134cbf57bda9db9214a90b607b6b4ab57fc026e RLP: 0x02a102dbac81e8486d68eac4e6ef9db617f7fbd79a04a3b323c982a09cdfc61f0ae0e8 \n\n(^) Make this page better \n\n\n### AccountKeyWeightedMultiSig \n\nAccountKeyWeightedMultiSig is an account key type containing a threshold and WeightedPublicKeys which contains a list consisting of a public key and its weight. In order for a transaction to be valid for an account associated with AccountKeyWeightedMultiSig, the following conditions should be satisfied: \n\n The weighted sum of the signed public keys should be larger than the threshold. The invalid signature should not be included in the transaction. The number of signed public keys should be less than the number of weightedPublicKeys. \n\n NOTE The following multiSig validation logic has been added with the IstanbulEVM hardfork. \n\n The invalid signature should not be included in the transaction. The number of signed public keys should be less than the number of weightedPublicKeys. \n\n**Attributes** \n\n Attribute Type Description \n\n Type uint8 (Go) The type of AccountKeyWeightedMultiSig. This must be 0x04. \n\n Threshold uint (Go) \n\n Validation threshold. To be a valid transaction, the weight sum of signatures should be larger than or equal to the threshold. \n\n WeightedPublicKeys \n\n []{uint, [33]byte} (Go) \n\n A list of weighted public keys. A weighted public key contains a compressed public key and its weight. \n\n**RLP Encoding** \n\n0x04 + encode([threshold, [[weight, CompressedPubKey1], [weight2, CompressedPubKey2]]]) \n\n**RLP Encoding (Example)** \n\n Threshold 3 Key0 Weight: 1 PubkeyX 0xc734b50ddb229be5e929fc4aa8080ae8240a802d23d3290e5e6156ce029b110e PubkeyY 0x61a443ac3ffff164d1fb3617875f07641014cf17af6b7dc38e429fe838763712 Key1 Weight: 1 \n\n Make this page better \n\n\n### AccountKeyRoleBased \n\nAccountKeyRoleBased represents a role-based key. The roles are specified at Roles. \n\n**Attributes** \n\n Attribute Type Description \n\n Type uint8 (Go) The type of AccountKeyRoleBased. It must be 0x05. \n\n Keys \n\n[] (^) {AccountKey} (Go) A list of keys. A key can be any of AccountKeyNil, AccountKeyLegacy, AccountKeyPublic, AccountKeyFail, and AccountKeyWeightedMultiSig. **Roles** Roles of AccountKeyRoleBased are defined as below: **Role Description** RoleTransaction Index 0. Default key. Transactions other than TxTypeAccountUpdate should be signed by the key of this role. RoleAccountUpdate Index 1. TxTypeAccountUpdate transaction should be signed by this key.

    " Transactions Basic \n\n# Basic \n\n## TxTypeLegacyTransaction \n\n#### TxTypeLegacyTransaction represents a type of transactions existed previously in Kaia. Since this \n\n#### transaction type exists to support compatibility, it only works with EOAs associated with \n\n#### AccountKeyLegacy. EOAs associated with other account key types should use other transaction types \n\n#### such as TxTypeValueTransfer, TxTypeSmartContractExecution, and so on. This type of transaction can \n\n#### create an account, transfer tokens, deploy a smart contract, execute a smart contract, or perform a mix \n\n#### of aforementioned. This transaction type will initiate the following changes. \n\n#### 1. The sender’s balance decreases by the amount of the transaction fee. \n\n#### 2. The sender’s nonce increases by one. \n\n3. If (^) to does not exist on Kaia, an EOA associated with AccountKeyLegacy is created. \n\n#### 4. value KAIA is transferred from the sender to the recipient. \n\n#### 5. If to^ is nil, it is regarded as a smart contract deployment transaction. The smart contract code must \n\n#### be passed as input. \n\n6. If (^) to is a smart contract, the smart contract function specified in (^) input is executed. \n\n## Attributes \n\n#### Attribute Type Description \n\n#### value *big.Int (Go) The amount of KAIA in kei to be transferred. \n\n#### to \n\n#### *common.Address \n\n#### (Go) \n\n#### The account address that will receive the transferred value. \n\n#### input []byte (Go) \n\n#### Data attached to the transaction, used for transaction \n\n#### execution. \n\n#### v, r, s *big.Int (Go) \n\n#### The cryptographic signature generated by the sender to let the \n\n#### receiver obtain the sender’s address. \n\n#### nonce uint64 (Go) \n\n#### A value used to uniquely identify a sender’s transaction. If two \n\n#### transactions with the same nonce are generated by a sender, \n\nonly one is executed. (^) Make this page better \n\n\n#### Attribute Type Description \n\n#### gas uint64 (Go) \n\n#### The maximum amount of transaction fee the transaction is \n\n#### allowed to use. \n\n#### gasPrice *big.Int (Go) \n\n#### A multiplier to get how much the sender will pay in tokens. The \n\namount of tokens the sender will pay is calculated via (^) gas * \n\n#### gasPrice. For example, the sender will pay 10 KAIA for a \n\n#### transaction fee if gas is 10 and gasPrice is 10^18.

If a user encountered such a \n\n#### situation, a transaction of TxTypeCancel can be submitted. \n\n#### Each of the above situations is handled as follows: 1. If the old transaction was lost, this TxTypeCancel \n\n#### transaction is executed and included in a block. 2. If the old transaction has not been processed yet, this \n\n#### TxTypeCancel replaces the old transaction.

Other transaction types cannot replace the transactions with the same nonce. \n\n#### The following changes can occur by this transaction type. 1.

The node URI must be shared with other Core Cells of the Core Cell Network. A CN connects to other CNs and a PN connects to a CN and some PNs using the created node URI. A node URI is created based on the node key by using the downloaded kgen. The below command line creates nodekey as well as node_info.json. \n\n kgen takes the associated IP and Port number as follows. \n\nThe (^) nodekey is a 64-byte hexadecimal string which is a private key used in the node internally. This private key must be present at the Kaia data directory and be careful not to lose it. $ kgen --ip \"123.456.789.012\" --port 32323 --file $ ls nodekey node_info.json Make this page better \n\n\nThe created file node_info.json includes the following contents. \n\n Key Name Description Example \n\n NodeAddress \n\n an address of the associated node \n\n 0xc8a23d67f2471066fa1b07270651fea7e5c0cf78 \n\n NodeKey \n\n the node key (a.k.a private key) \n\n aaa7248dfdf19418ae9121a0f39db39c5c27a3e404ea7c1b8e020ca8dbe \n\n NodeURI node URI kni://4f2f47f3bf35a2c576d3345e6e9c49b147d510c05832d2458709f6 discport=0 \n\n node_info.json contains the node information in a JSON format as follows. \n\n## Node URI Enrollment \n\nThe created node URI should be enrolled to participate in the Core Cell Network (CCN). The process of the enrollment is as follows. \n\n1. Create a node URI using (^) kgen ( (^) node_info.json ) which contains the associated IP and Port number. \n\n2. Send the information to the official Kaia email address ( bootstrap@klaytn.com for Mainnet or     baobab@klaytn.com for Kairos). \n\nThe enrolled information should be sent to the official Kaia email address.

    " Advanced Topics Data Management Block Synchronization \n\n# Block Synchronization \n\n#### Block synchronization is the process of updating a node with the latest blocks and states from the Kaia \n\n#### blockchain. Node operators can choose from various synchronization methods based on their hardware \n\n#### specifications and service requirements. \n\n## Full Sync \n\nFull sync is the default synchronization method in Kaia, activated by either using the (^) --syncmode full \n\n#### flag or omitting the flag altogether. This method involves downloading and executing every block \n\n#### (header and transactions) from p2p peers to generate the block states. \n\n## State Persistence Options \n\n#### While Full Sync processes every block, Kaia provides flexibility in how much state data is persistently \n\n#### stored on disk. This allows node operators to balance data accessibility with storage capacity. The \n\n#### following diagram illustrates these options: \n\n\n**Archive Mode** : This mode persists every block state to disk. To enable it, use the (^) --gcmode \n\n#### archive flag. Nodes operating in this mode are referred to as Archive Nodes. \n\n#### Full Mode : This mode persists block states at specific intervals to optimize disk usage. To enable it, \n\n#### use the --gcmode full flag or omit the --gcmode flag altogether. Nodes operating in this mode \n\n#### are referred to as Full Nodes. Don’t confuse this with the general \"full sync\" method. \n\n#### In a full node, block states are persisted to disk every multiple of the number specified by -\n\n#### state.block-interval NNN (default: 128). Also the block states of the recent --state.tries-in\n\n#### memory NNN (default: 128) blocks are kept in memory to serve APIs. Therefore, block states are available \n\n#### only when it is a multiple of block interval or recently processed. \n\n // State available > eth.getBalance('0xf39Fd6e51aad88F6F4ce6aB8827279cffFb92266', 150000000 ) 735000000000002 \n\n // State absent > eth.getBalance('0xf39Fd6e51aad88F6F4ce6aB8827279cffFb92266', 150000001 ) Error: missing trie node 64380 a8de7bd83a6421c9ad45ae596a0eebbc7b504d061f4a57c61742eadc804 at web3.js: 6812 : 9 ( 39 ) \n\n Make this page better \n\n\n##### INFO \n\n#### Applications should not assume a fixed block interval of 128. While it’s the default, nodes can be \n\n#### configured to use different intervals. \n\n#### Choosing the Right Option \n\n#### Applications typically need access to the latest state data, including nonces, balances, and contract \n\n#### storage. While apps and developers may occasionally utilize debug tracing APIs for historical blocks, \n\n#### these blocks can generally be recreated by re-executing transactions from the nearest stored state \n\n#### (e.g., up to 127 blocks prior under the default block interval). Therefore, running a full node is a cost\n\n#### effective choice for most applications. \n\n#### However, data analysis often requires using an archive node. It’s important to note that even when \n\n#### querying historical consensus data, such as validator information or rewards, an archive node is still \n\n#### required. This is because consensus data is derived from the state of the blockchain at specific block \n\n#### heights. \n\n#### To summarize: \n\n#### Full Node: Suitable for most applications requiring access to the latest state data and occasional \n\n#### historical data access via tracing APIs. \n\n#### Archive Node: Essential for applications requiring comprehensive historical state access, such as \n\n#### data analysis tools. \n\n### Hybrid Option: Upstream EN \n\n#### If your node mostly serves the latest data but occasionally serves historic data, then try the Upstream \n\n#### EN feature. This feature allows you to balance the storage requirements of an archive node with the \n\n#### performance of a full node. \n\n## Chaindata Snapshot \n\n#### Chaindata snapshots offer a faster alternative to Full Sync. A snapshot is a compressed archive (e.g. \n\n#### .tar.gz file) of a synced node’s data directory. Downloading and extracting a snapshot allows a new \n\n#### node to quickly catch up to the blockchain without processing every block individually. See Use \n\n#### Chaindata Snapshots for more information. \n\n at send (web3.js: 5223 : 62 ( 29 )) at <eval>: 1 : 15 ( 4 ) \n\n\n## Snap Sync \n\n#### Currently, Kaia nodes do not support the Snap Sync method. However, using a chaindata snapshot \n\n#### provides a comparable advantage in terms of faster initial synchronization. \n\n#### Edit this page \n\nLast updated on **Jan 24, 2025** \n\n#### Is this page helpful? \n\n\n",

Introduction \n\n#### This tutorial helps you to write a simple server-client example using caver-js SDK to illustrate how fee \n\n#### delegated value transfer transaction works in Kaia. This tutorial and the example code is using the Kairos \n\n#### testnet. \n\n## 2. How fee delegation works \n\n#### Let’s skim through how fee delegation works. \n\n## 2.1 Transaction signing by the sender \n\n#### Sender always should sign the transaction before sending a transaction. \n\n#### To sign a transaction, use signTransaction which signs a transaction with given private key. \n\n // using the event emitter const senderAddress = \"SENDER_ADDRESS\"; const senderPrivateKey = \"SENDER_PRIVATEKEY\";^ Make^ this^ page^ better \n\n\n#### If there are no errors, then senderRawTransaction will have a signed transaction which is signed by \n\n#### the senderPrivateKey^. \n\n#### Now, you need to send the senderRawTransaction to the fee payer. There will be various ways to \n\n#### implement this. In this tutorial, we will provide you a simple server-client code as an example of sending \n\n#### a senderRawTransaction to the fee payer. \n\n### 2.2 Transaction signing by the fee payer \n\n#### When fee^ payer^ receives the senderRawTransaction^ , fee^ payer^ signs the \n\n#### senderRawTransaction again with their private key and sends the transaction to Kaia. The below code \n\nsnippet illustrates the process. (^) kaia.sendRawTransaction method signs the transaction with the \n\n#### given account’s private key before sending the transaction. Before running the code, please replace \n\n\"FEEPAYER_ADDRESS\" (^) and \"PRIVATE_KEY\" (^) with the actual values. \n\n#### Note that when the fee payer submits the transaction to Kaia on behalf of the sender , the \n\n#### senderRawTransaction type must be a^ FEE_DELEGATED type of transaction. In the below example, \n\n#### sendTransaction(FEE_DELEGATED_VALUE_TRANSFER) method is invoked, because the original \n\nsenderRawTransaction (^) generated by the sender was TxTypeFeeDelegatedValueTransfer. const toAddress TO_ADDRESS ; // Create a new transaction const tx = caver.transaction.feeDelegatedValueTransfer.create({ from: keyring.address, to: toAddress, value: caver.utils.toPeb(\"0.0001\", \"KAIA\"), gas: 100000, gasPrice: await caver.rpc.klay.getGasPrice(), // Get current gas price chainId: await caver.rpc.klay.getChainId(), // Get current chain ID }); // Sign the transaction const signed = await caver.wallet.sign(keyring.address, tx); const senderRawTransaction = tx.getRLPEncoding(); const feePayerAddress = \"FEEPAYER_ADDRESS\"; const feePayerPrivateKey = \"PRIVATE_KEY\" const tx = caver.transaction.decode(senderRawTransaction); console.log(\"Decoded transaction:\", tx); tx.feePayer = keyring.address; const signed = await caver.wallet.signAsFeePayer(keyring.address, tx); // Send the transaction const receipt = await caver.rpc.klay.sendRawTransaction( signed.getRLPEncoding() Make this page better \n\n\n## 3. Simple server and client for fee delegation \n\n#### Let’s write a simple server and client using above fee delegation code. \n\n### 3.1 Environment setup \n\n#### We will use npm and caver-js to setup environment for this example as below. \n\n### 3.1 Sender's client \n\n#### First, we are going to write a sender_client.js as below. \n\n#### In the example, please replace \"SENDER_ADDRESS\"^ , \"SENDER_PRIVATEKEY\"^ and \"TO_ADDRESS\"^ with \n\n#### the actual values. \n\n##### ) \n\n .on('transactionHash', function(hash){ ... }) .on('receipt', function(receipt){ ... }) .on('error', console.error); // If an out-of-gas error, the second parameter is the recei \n\n $ mkdir example $ cd example $ npm init $ npm install caver-js@latest \n\n import { Socket } from \"net\"; import Caver from \"caver-js\"; \n\n const client = new Socket(); const caver = new Caver(\"https://public-en-kairos.node.kaia.io\"); \n\n const senderAddress = \"SENDER_ADDRESS\"; const senderPrivateKey = \"SENDER_PRIVATE_KEY\"; const toAddress = \"TO_ADDRESS\"; \n\n const sendFeeDelegateTx = async () => { try { // Add sender's keyring to wallet const keyring = caver.wallet.newKeyring(senderAddress, senderPrivateKey); \n\n // Create a new transaction const tx = caver.transaction.feeDelegatedValueTransfer.create({ from: keyring.address,^ Make^ this^ page^ better \n\n\n#### The above code signs a fee delegated value transfer transaction with senderPrivateKey and sends \n\n#### the signed senderRawTransaction to the fee payer’s server which is running on port 1337 on \n\n#### 127.0.0.1 , i.e. localhost. \n\n### 3.2 Fee payer's server \n\nNow let’s write the fee payer’s server, (^) feepayer_server.js , which signs received \n\n#### senderRawTransaction with feePayerPrivateKey and sends it to Kairos testnet. \n\n#### In the below example, please replace \"FEEPAYER_ADDRESS\"^ and \"FEEPAYER_PRIVATEKEY\"^ with actual \n\n#### values. \n\n to: toAddress, value: caver.utils.toPeb(\"0.0001\", \"KAIA\"), gas: 100000 , gasPrice: await caver.rpc.klay.getGasPrice(), // Get current gas price chainId: await caver.rpc.klay.getChainId(), // Get current chain ID }); \n\n // Sign the transaction const signed = await caver.wallet.sign(keyring.address, tx); \n\n const senderRawTransaction = tx.getRLPEncoding(); \n\n if (!senderRawTransaction) { throw new Error(\"Failed to generate raw transaction\"); } \n\n // Send signed raw transaction to fee payer's server client.connect( 1337 , \"127.0.0.1\", () => { console.log(\"Connected to fee delegated service\"); client.write(senderRawTransaction); }); \n\n client.on(\"data\", ( data ) => { console.log(\"Received data from server:\", data.toString()); }); \n\n client.on(\"error\", ( error ) => { console.error(\"Connection error:\", error); s; }); \n\n client.on(\"close\", () => { console.log(\"Connection closed\"); }); } catch (error) { console.error(\"Transaction error:\", error); client.end(); process.exit( 1 ); } }; \n\n sendFeeDelegateTx(); \n\n Make this page better \n\n\nimport { createServer } from \"net\"; import Caver from \"caver-js\"; \n\nconst caver = **new** Caver(\"https://public-en-kairos.node.kaia.io\"); const feePayerAddress = \"FEEPAYER_ADDRESS\"; const feePayerPrivateKey = \"FEEPAYER_PRIVATE_KEY\"; \n\n// add fee payer's keyring to wallet \n\nconst keyring = caver.wallet.newKeyring(feePayerAddress, feePayerPrivateKey); \n\nconst feePayerSign = async ( _senderRawTransaction_ , _socket_ ) => { try { const tx = caver.transaction.decode(senderRawTransaction); console.log(\"Decoded transaction:\", tx); \n\n tx.feePayer = keyring.address; \n\n const signed = await caver.wallet.signAsFeePayer(keyring.address, tx); \n\n // Send the transaction const receipt = await caver.rpc.klay.sendRawTransaction( signed.getRLPEncoding() ); console.log(\"Transaction receipt:\", receipt); \n\nif (receipt.transactionHash) { socket.write(`Tx hash: ${receipt.transactionHash}\\n`); socket.write(`Sender Tx hash: ${receipt.senderTxHash || \"\"}\\n`); } } catch (error) { console.error(\"Error in feePayerSign:\", error); socket.write(`Error: ${error.message}\\n`); } }; \n\nvar server = createServer(function ( _socket_ ) { console.log(\"Client is connected ...\"); socket.write(\"This is fee delegating service\"); socket.write(\"Fee payer is \" + feePayerAddress); socket.on(\"data\", function ( _data_ ) { console.log(\"Received data from client:\", data.toString()); feePayerSign(data.toString(), socket); }); socket.on(\"error\", ( _error_ ) => { console.error(\"Socket error:\", error); }); \n\nsocket.on(\"end\", () => { console.log(\"Client disconnected\"); }); }); \n\nserver.listen( 1337 , \"127.0.0.1\"); console.log(\"Fee delegate service started ...\"); Make this page better \n\n\n#### The server listens on port 1337. \n\n#### When there is incoming data , it signs the data with feePayerPrivateKey and sends it to the Kaia \n\n#### blockchain. It assumes that the data is senderRawTransaction from the sender_client.js. \n\n## 4. Run example \n\n#### Prepare two terminals, one for sender_client.js and another for feepayer_server.js. \n\n**4.1 Run** (^) **feepayer_server.js** \n\n#### Below the command will start the fee payer’s server. \n\n#### The server starts and is now listening on port 1337. \n\n**4.2 Run** (^) **sender_client.js** \n\n#### Let’s run sender_client.js to send a fee delegated transaction. \n\nIt will sign a transaction with the (^) sender private key and send the signed transaction to the fee \n\n#### delegated service (i.e., fee payer’s server). Then it will receive the response from the fee delegate \n\n#### service including the Fee^ payer^ address, Tx^ hash^ , and Sender^ Tx^ hash^. Tx^ hash^ is hash of a \n\n#### transaction submitted to the Kaia network, while Sender Tx hash is hash of a transaction without the \n\n#### fee payer’s address and signature. For more details, please take a look at SenderTxHash. \n\n**4.3 Check** (^) **feepayer_server.js** \n\n#### On the server’s console, you will see below outputs. It prints the transaction receipt from the Kaia. \n\n $ node feepayer_server.js Fee delegate service started ... \n\n $ node sender_client.js Signed a fee delegated value transfer transaction.

If you’re unfamiliar with some of these terms, each concept will be explained thoroughly. \n\n Make this page better \n\n\nEdit this page Last updated on **Jan 24, 2025** \n\n Make this page better \n\n\n",
    " Build Mini dApps on LINE with Unity Build Unity App \n\n# Build Unity App \n\n## Prerequisites \n\n#### Before we dive in, make sure you have: \n\n#### Unity Hub installed on your computer this is where we'll build our dApp interface \n\n#### Basic C# and JavaScript knowledge nothing too fancy, just the fundamentals \n\n#### A LINE Developer account you can easily create one using your email \n\n#### Test Kaia from Kaia Faucet \n\n#### Dapp Portal SDK Client ID receiveed from Dapp Portal team. \n\n#### Some familiarity with Web3 concepts if you understand wallets and tokens, you’re good to go. \n\n## Setting Up Your Unity Environment \n\n#### Let’s set up your development environment. We'll start with the Unity setup. \n\n## Step 1: Install and Verify Unity Version \n\n#### To begin, let’s make sure we’re all using the same Unity version to avoid any compatibility issues: \n\n#### Install Unity Hub if you haven’t already. \n\n#### Install Unity Editor version 2022.3.50f1 specifically. \n\n## Step 2: Create Your New Unity Project \n\n#### 1. Open Unity Hub and head to the Projects tab. \n\n#### 2. Click the inviting \"New project\" button in the top-right corner. \n\n#### 3. Under \"All templates\", select the 3D (Built-in Render Pipeline) template. \n\n#### 4. Give your project a meaningful name (e.g., mini-dApp-example). \n\n#### 5. Choose a convenient location for your project files. \n\n#### 6. Click Create project. \n\n\n## Creating Your dApp's UI Components \n\n#### In this section, we will build our dApp’s user interface! We'll create a structured UI system with three \n\n#### main panels for status updates, actions, and minting functionality. \n\n### Setting Up the Main Canvas \n\n#### First, let’s create our base canvas: \n\n#### 1. In the Hierarchy window, right-click on \"Sample Scene\". \n\n#### 2. Navigate to GameObject → UI → Canvas. \n\n### Creating the Web3UI Container \n\n#### 1. Right-click on your new Canvas. \n\n#### 2. Select \"Create Empty\". \n\n#### 3. Rename it to \"Web3UI\". \n\n### Setting Up Main Panels \n\n#### Inside Web3UI, create three panel objects: \n\n\n#### 1. Right-click on Web3UI and select \"Create Empty\". \n\n#### 2. Create and rename these panels: \n\n#### StatusPanel Your dApp’s information display \n\n#### ButtonPanel For user interactions \n\n#### MintPanel For token minting features \n\n### Creating Panel Components \n\n#### StatusPanel Components \n\n#### This panel shows all your important Web3 information: \n\n#### Right click on StatusPanel, click on UI → Text TextMeshPro and then rename to StatusText. Make \n\n#### sure to fill the “Text Input” field in the Inspector pane e.g. \"Status...\" \n\n##### NOTE \n\n#### TextMeshPro (TMP) Setup \n\n#### When you first create a TextMeshPro element (UI Text TextMeshPro), Unity automatically \n\n#### prompts you to import TMP Essentials. If you accidentally skip this prompt, you can manually import \n\n#### it through Window > TextMeshPro > Import TMP Essentials. \n\n#### Why we need this: TextMeshPro requires core resources (shaders, default fonts, and materials) to \n\n#### properly display text in your game. Without these essentials, your text components won’t render \n\n#### correctly and you’ll see shader/material errors in your project. This is a one-time setup that’s \n\n#### necessary for text to work properly. \n\n\n\n#### Right click on StatusPanel, click on UI → Text TextMeshPro and then rename to AddressText. Make \n\n#### sure to fill the text object e.g \"Address Text...\" \n\n#### Right click on StatusPanel, click on UI → Text TextMeshPro and then rename to TokenBalanceText. \n\n#### Make sure to fill the text object e.g \"0.0000 ET\" \n\n#### ButtonPanel Components \n\n#### Your main interaction buttons: \n\n#### Right click on ButtonPanel, click on UI → Button TextMeshPro and then rename it to \n\n#### ConnectWalletButton. Make sure to fill the \"Text Input\" field in the Inspector pane with \"Connect \n\n#### Wallet\". \n\n#### MintPanel Components \n\n#### The token minting interface: \n\n#### Right click on MintPanel, click on UI → Input Field → TextMeshPro and then rename to \n\n#### MintAmountInput. Make sure to fill the placeholder object with \"Enter Amount…\" \n\n#### Right click on MintPanel, click on UI → Button → TextMeshPro and then rename to MintButton. Make \n\n#### sure to fill the text object with \"Mint\" \n\n#### After creating all components, your hierarchy should look like this: \n\n ├── StatusText (TextMeshPro) │ └── Default: \"Status...\" ├── AddressText (TextMeshPro) │ └── Default: \"Address Text...\" └── TokenBalanceText (TextMeshPro) └── Default: \"0.0000 ET\" \n\n ButtonPanel ├── ConnectButton (Button TextMeshPro) │ └── Text: \"Connect Wallet\" \n\n MintPanel ├── MintAmountInput (Input Field TextMeshPro) │ └── Placeholder: \"Enter Amount...\" └── MintButton (Button TextMeshPro) └── Text: \"Mint\" \n\n Canvas └── Web3UI ├── StatusPanel ├── ButtonPanel \n\n Make this page better \n\n\n##### NOTE \n\n#### For your component to be well arranged as seen in the image above, you have to manually arrange \n\n#### them with the icon on the right-hand side when you click on each component. \n\n## Setting Up Web3 Integration \n\n#### In this section, we will build up pieces to integrate web3 into our Unity project. \n\n### Creating and deploying KIP7 smart contract \n\n#### First, we'll use Kaia Contract Wizard to generate our smart contract. \n\n#### Step 1: Using Kaia Contract Wizard \n\n#### 1. Navigate to Kaia Contract Wizard. \n\n#### 2. Select KIP7 (Kaia’s token standard, similar to ERC20). \n\n#### 3. Configure your token: \n\n#### Name: ExampleTestToken (or something else!) \n\n#### Symbol: ET (your token’s ticker) \n\n └── MintPanel \n\n Make this page better \n\n\n#### Premint: 100 (initial token supply) \n\n#### Features: Check ✅ Mintable \n\n#### For this guide, we will tweak the mint function not to have onlyOwner modifier. To do this, we have to \n\n#### remove the ownable.sol import, and Ownable inheritance. The tweaked code should now look like this: \n\n##### INFO \n\n#### We removed the onlyOwner modifier to allow anyone to call the mint function other than the \n\n#### original deployer or owner of the contract. \n\n#### Step 2: Deploying via Remix IDE \n\n1. Copy and Paste the code above in a newly created file (^) ET.sol on Remix IDE. \n\n#### 2. In Remix IDE: \n\n#### Click the Compile contract button. \n\n#### Activate the Kaia plugin in the plugin manager. \n\n#### Under Environment in the Kaia Plugin tab, choose Injected Provider Kaia Wallet. \n\n#### Find your contract (ExampleTokens) in the Contract dropdown. \n\n#### Click Deploy to launch your token! \n\n#### 3. When your Kaia Wallet pops up: \n\n#### Review the deployment details. \n\n#### Click Confirm to deploy to Kaia Kairos Testnet. \n\n // SPDX-License-Identifier: MIT pragma solidity ^0.8. 4 ; import \"@kaiachain/contracts/KIP/token/KIP7/KIP7.sol\"; contract ExampleTokens is KIP7 { constructor() KIP7(\"ExampleTokens\", \"ET\") { _mint(msg.sender, 100 * 10 ** decimals()); } function supportsInterface( bytes4 interfaceId ) public view virtual override returns ( bool ) { return super .supportsInterface(interfaceId); } function mint( uint256 amount ) public { _mint(msg.sender, amount); } } \n\n\n##### IMPORTANT \n\n#### Copy and save the deployed contract address. You'll need it later in the tutorial. \n\n## Building the Unity-Web3 Bridge \n\n#### Now we'll create the vital connection between Unity and Web3 functionality. This is where we bring \n\n#### blockchain capabilities into your Unity application! \n\n### Part 1: Creating the Plugin Bridge (kaiaPlugin.jslib) \n\n#### First, we'll build our JavaScript bridge that lets Unity talk to Web3: \n\n#### 1. Create your plugin directory: \n\n#### 2. Why a .jslib? Think of it as a translator between Unity’s C# and the browser’s JavaScript essential \n\n#### for Web3 interactions! \n\n#### 3. The plugin will handle three core functions: \n\n#### ConnectWallet() Handles Kaia Wallet connections \n\n#### GetTokenBalance() Checks token balances \n\n#### MintTokens() Manages token minting \n\nOpen this file in VS Code and paste the (^) KaiaPlugin.jslib source code in Appendix A: \n\n### Part 2: Creating the C# Manager (Web3Manager.cs) \n\n#### Next, we'll create our C# script to manage all Web3 operations: \n\n#### 1. Create your scripts directory: \n\n Assets/ └── Plugins/ └── WebGL/ └── KaiaPlugin.jslib // We'll create this file \n\n Assets/ └── Scripts/ └── Web3/ └── Web3Manager.cs // We'll create this file \n\n\n##### INFO \n\n#### What does Web3Manager do? \n\n#### Acts as the main conductor for all Web3 operations. \n\n#### Manages communication with our JavaScript plugin. \n\n#### Updates UI elements based on blockchain events. \n\n#### Handles all wallet and token operations. \n\n#### Connects the Connect Wallet and Mint buttons with their respective functions \n\n#### 2. Open this file in VS Code and paste the Web3Manager.cs^ source code in Appendix B \n\n### Part 3: Setting Up the Web3Manager GameObject \n\n#### Finally, let’s bring it all together in Unity: \n\n#### 1. Create the Manager Object: \n\n#### Right-click in the Hierarchy window (root level). \n\n#### Select \"Create Empty Object\". \n\n#### Name it \"Web3Manager\". \n\n#### 2. Attach Your Script: \n\n#### Select the Web3Manager GameObject. \n\n#### In Inspector, click Add Component. \n\n#### Search for and select \"Web3Manager\". \n\n#### 3. Connect UI Elements: \n\n#### With Web3Manager selected, look in the Inspector. \n\n#### Drag and drop your UI elements from the Hierarchy to the corresponding fields: \n\n#### StatusText \n\n#### AddressText \n\n#### TokenBalanceText \n\n#### Connect / Mint buttons \n\n#### Input fields \n\n\n## Setting Up WebGL Build Settings \n\n#### In this section, we will configure our dApp for the web! This will configure Unity for Web3 compatibility \n\n#### and create a custom template for Kaia integration. \n\n### Step 1: Switch to WebGL Platform \n\n#### 1. Navigate to File → Build Settings. \n\n#### 2. Select WebGL and click \"Switch Platform\". \n\n##### NOTE \n\n#### This might take a few minutes if it’s your first time switching. \n\n\n### Step 2: Creating a Custom WebGL Template \n\n#### We need a custom template to integrate Web3 capabilities. Here’s our folder structure: \n\n##### INFO \n\n#### Why Custom Template? \n\n#### The default Unity template doesn’t include Web3 support. Our custom template will: \n\n#### Load necessary Web3 libraries. \n\n#### Enable Kaia Wallet integration. \n\n#### Handle blockchain interactions properly. \n\n### Step 3: Setting Up index.html \n\n Assets/ └── WebGLTemplates/ └── KaiaTemplate/ ├── index.html └── scripts/ └── dapp_portal_sdk.js \n\n\nCopy and paste the code below in your (^) index.html file: <!DOCTYPE html> <html lang=\"en-us\"> <head> <meta charset=\"utf-8\"> <meta name=\"viewport\" content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0\"> <title>Unity WebGL Player</title> <script src=\"scripts/dapp_portal_sdk.js\"></script> <style> body { margin: 0; padding: 0; } #unity-container { width: 100%; height: 100%; position: absolute; } #unity-canvas { width: 100%; height: 100%; background: #231F20; } #unity-loading-bar { display: none; } #unity-progress-bar-empty { width: 141px; height: 18px; margin-top: 10px; background #unity-progress-bar-full { width: 0%; height: 18px; margin-top: 10px; background: ur </style> </head> <body> <div id=\"unity-container\"> <canvas id=\"unity-canvas\"></canvas> <div id=\"unity-loading-bar\"> <div id=\"unity-progress-bar-empty\"> <div id=\"unity-progress-bar-full\"></div> </div> </div> </div> <script src=\"Build/minidapp.loader.js\"></script> <script> var sdk = null; var connectedAddress = null; var myGameInstance = null; var Module = { onRuntimeInitialized: function() { console.log(\"Runtime initialized\"); }, env: { MintToken: function(amount) { window.MintToken(amount); }, GetBalance: function() { window.GetBalance(); }, ConnectWallet: function() { window.ConnectWallet(); }, GetConnectedAddress: function() { var address = window.GetConnectedAddress(); var bufferSize = lengthBytesUTF8(address) + 1; var buffer = _malloc(bufferSize); stringToUTF8(address, buffer, bufferSize); return buffer; } } }; \n\n\nasync function initializeSDK() { try { sdk = await DappPortalSDK.init({ clientId: 'PASTE CLIENT ID', chainId: '1001' }); console.log(\"SDK initialized\"); return true; } catch (error) { console.error(\"SDK init error:\", error); return false; } } \n\nwindow.ConnectWallet = async function() { try { if (!sdk) { const initialized = await initializeSDK(); if (!initialized) return null; } \n\n const provider = sdk.getWalletProvider(); const accounts = await provider.request({ method: 'kaia_requestAccounts' }); \n\nif (accounts && accounts.length > 0) { connectedAddress = accounts[0]; myGameInstance.SendMessage('Web3Manager', 'OnWalletConnected', connectedAddres } } catch (error) { myGameInstance.SendMessage('Web3Manager', 'OnWalletError', error.message); } } \n\nwindow.GetConnectedAddress = function() { return connectedAddress || ''; } \n\nwindow.MintToken = async function(amount) { try { const provider = sdk.getWalletProvider(); \n\n const mintSignature = '0xa0712d68'; const amountHex = amount.toString(16).padStart(64, '0'); const data = mintSignature + amountHex; \n\n const tx = { from: connectedAddress, to: '0x099D7feC4f799d1749adA8815eB21375E13E0Ddb', value: '0x0', data: data, gas: '0x4C4B40' }; \n\n const txHash = await provider.request({ method: 'kaia_sendTransaction', params: [tx] }); \n\n myGameInstance.SendMessage('Web3Manager', 'OnMintSuccess', txHash);Make^ this^ page^ better \n\n\n### Step 4: Setting Up Dapp Portal SDK \n\n#### 1.

Conclusion \n\n## Introduction \n\n#### Buy Me a Coffee (BMC) is a platform where creators get monetary support and donations from their fans \n\n#### or audience. These creators could be writers, artists, musicians, video creators, et al. With the help of \n\n#### this platform, fans may play a significant role in the success stories of creators, audiences can express \n\n#### their appreciation for the job that creators accomplish, and creators can monetize their work. \n\n#### On a high level, Buy-me-a-Coffee simplifies the process of accepting payments for creators and \n\n#### enhances interactions between creators and audiences. These and more are some of the exciting \n\n#### features on the BMC platform. On the bright side, imagine this platform on the blockchain. Creators will \n\n#### now get access to more benefits, such as: \n\n#### Complete payment, as opposed to traditional BMC, which charges 5% on any support received by \n\n#### the creator. \n\n#### Transparency because all transactions are recorded on the blockchain. \n\n#### Directly receive support fees from fans without any intermediary. \n\n#### Decentralization, i.e., there is no central authority controlling the platform. \n\n#### In this tutorial. you will build a decentralized version of the Buy Me a Coffee (BMC) platform (frontend + \n\n#### smart contract). This platform will be a minimalistic implementation of the traditional BMC platform \n\n#### where supporters can tip you, and you will be able to withdraw any tips that are delivered to the BMC \n\n#### smart contract as the contract’s owner. Supporters will be able to send test KAIA and lovely messages \n\n#### together in a coffee transaction using this site. \n\n#### By the end of this guide, you will have used the following to create this dApp: Make^ this^ page^ better \n\n\n#### Solidity: to write the BMC smart contract \n\n#### NextJs and Tailwind: for building a frontend website for our BMC dApp \n\n#### Web3Onboard: to enable multiple wallet connections to Kaia Testnet Kairos. \n\n#### Fleek: with Fleek we can host our BMC dApp on IPFS. \n\n## Prerequisites \n\n#### To complete this tutorial, you will need: \n\n#### Node.js \n\n#### Familiarity with Javascript and React basics such as hooks etc \n\n#### Installation of the necessary wallets, such as Coinbase Wallet, and Metamask Wallet \n\n#### Test KAIA from Faucet. \n\n#### RPC Endpoint: you can obtain this from one of the supported endpoint providers. \n\n#### Creation of an account on Fleek. \n\n## 1. Project Setup \n\n#### In this section, we will initialize our project folder. This folder will contain two separate folders: \n\n#### 1. frontend folder which contains the code for the frontend implementation of our dApp \n\n#### 2. smart-contract folder which contains the smart contract code for our BMC dApp. \n\n#### To create our project folder, paste this code in your terminal \n\n### 1.1. Frontend folder \n\n#### This folder contains the tools to build our project frontend website. For the sake of this guide, we will be \n\n#### using Next’s create-next-app utility to bootstrap our Next.js and Tailwind CSS project. Follow the steps \n\n#### below to install the necessary dependencies and get our frontend folder created: \n\n#### Step 1 Creating a frontend folder \n\n#### Paste the code below in your BuyMeACoffee folder to create a frontend folder using create-next-app \n\n#### utility: \n\n mkdir BuyMeACoffee cd BuyMeACoffee \n\n npx create-next-app frontend \n\n Make this page better \n\n\n#### Step 2 Downloading the Tailwind dependencies and setting up its config \n\n**Step 3 Modifying** (^) **tailwind.config.js** Navigate to the (^) tailwind.config.js file and replace with the code below: \n\n#### Step 4 Replacing the code in styles/global.css \n\n#### Navigate to the styles/global.css file and replace with the code below: \n\n#### We have successfully set up our frontend project folder. More will be discussed later on. The next step is \n\n#### to set up the smart contract folder. \n\n### 1.2. Smart Contract Folder \n\n#### This folder contains the smart contract for our BuyMeACoffee functionality. Follow the steps below to \n\n#### install the necessary dependencies and get our smart contract folder created: \n\n#### Step 1 Creating the smart contract folder \n\n#### To create this folder, navigate to the project directory: BuyMeACoffee and create a smart-contract \n\n#### folder by running the command below: \n\n cd frontend \n\n npm install -D tailwindcss postcss autoprefixer npx tailwindcss init -p \n\n module. exports = { content: [ \"./pages/**/*.{js,ts,jsx,tsx}\", \"./components/**/*.{js,ts,jsx,tsx}\", ], theme: { extend: {}, }, plugins: [], } \n\n @tailwind base; @tailwind components; @tailwind utilities; \n\n cd .. mkdir smart-contract \n\n Make this page better \n\n\n#### Step 2 Generating a hardhat project template \n\n#### This template is suitable for writing, testing and deploying smart contracts. Firstly, start a new npm \n\n#### project by running the code below in your terminal: \n\n#### This should create a package.json file for you that looks like this: \n\n#### Then, install hardhat and other dependencies such as hardhat-toolbox and dotenv. To do so, replace \n\n#### your package.json file with the code below: \n\nFinally, run (^) npm install in your terminal. \n\n#### After successfully installing all the dependencies(hardhat, hardhat-toolbox, dotenv), you can confirm \n\n#### hardhat installation by: \n\n#### a. Checking the current version: \n\n cd smart-contract \n\n npm init -y \n\n###### { \n\n \"name\": \"buymeacoffee\", \"version\": \"1.0.0\", \"description\": \"\", \"main\": \"index.js\", \"scripts\": { \"test\": \"echo \\\"Error: no test specified\\\" && exit 1 \" }, \"keywords\": [], \"author\": \"\", \"license\": \"ISC\" } \n\n###### { \n\n \"name\": \"buymeacoffee\", \"devDependencies\": { \"@nomicfoundation/hardhat-toolbox\": \"^2.0.2\", \"hardhat\": \"^2.14.0\" }, \"dependencies\": { \"dotenv\": \"^16.0.3\" } } \n\n npx hardhat --version^ Make^ this^ page^ better \n\n\n#### Your console should print out the current version installed which in our case is 2.14.0. \n\n#### b. Viewing your project directory. Your current directory should include: \n\n#### contracts/ – this is the folder containing the smart contract. \n\n#### scripts/ – this folder contains code that deploys your contracts on the blockchain network \n\n#### test/ – this folder contains all unit tests that test your smart contract \n\n#### hardhat.config.ts – this file contains configurations important for the work of Hardhat and the \n\n#### deployment of smart contracts. \n\n## 2. Creating a Buy Me A Coffee Smart Contract \n\n#### In this section we will be creating the smart contract that houses the BMC functionality. To get started, \n\n#### navigate to your contracts folder, create a new file named BuyMeACoffee.sol and paste this code \n\n#### below: \n\n // SPDX-License-Identifier: UNLICENSED pragma solidity ^0.8.9; contract BuyMeACoffee { // event to emit when a message is sent with tip event NewCoffee ( address indexed _sender , string name , string _message , uint256 _times \n\n // address of contract deployer address payable owner; constructor() { // stores deployer as owner owner = payable( msg.sender ); } \n\n // struct of BuyMeACoffe Tx struct BuyCoffee { address sender; string name; uint timestamp; string message; } \n\n // maps id to BuyCoffee struct mapping ( uint => BuyCoffee) idToBuyCoffee; \n\n // id uint public coffeeId; \n\n // buy coffee function function buyCoffee( string memory name , string memory message ) public payable { // Must accept more than 0 KAIA for a coffee. require( msg .value > 0 , \"Tip must be greater than zero\"); coffeeId++; \n\n // Add the coffee tx to storage \n\n Make this page better \n\n\n#### Let’s quickly go over what each line of code does: \n\n#### The NewCoffee event is emitted when a buyCoffee function is executed. It logs out the address of the \n\n#### sender, the name of the sender, the message sent, and the timestamp. \n\n#### Next is the owner variable, which represents the contract deployer. We then set the msg.sender to be \n\n#### the owner of the contract in our constructor. \n\n#### The coffeeId was created to keep track of the coffee transaction created. \n\n#### Subsequently we declared a buyMeACoffee struct , which stores all the data related to a coffee \n\n#### transaction; address sender, string name, uint timestamp, string message. We then mapped this struct \n\n#### to an id using the idToBuyCoffee variable. \n\n#### The buyCoffee function is the core implementation of BMC smart contract. It is a payable function which \n\n#### takes in two parameters, the name and address of the sender. It checks if the KAIA amount sent in is \n\n#### greater than zero. Next it increments the coffeeId, then it adds the coffee tx or info to the blockchain. \n\n#### Finally it emits a NewCoffee event, which entails the details of the coffee tx. \n\n#### We created a withdraw() function to withdraw the total balance of the contract \n\n#### ( address(this).balance ) to the owner. \n\n#### Finally, a getAllCoffee() function was created. It returns all the coffee transactions created overtime. \n\n BuyCoffee storage coffee = idToBuyCoffee[coffeeId]; coffee.message = message; coffee.name = name; coffee.sender = msg.sender ; coffee.timestamp = block .timestamp; // Emit a NewCoffee event with details about the coffee tx. emit NewCoffee( msg.sender , name, message, block .timestamp); } \n\n // withdraw coffee tips to the contract owner function withdrawCoffeTips() public { require(owner == msg.sender , \"Not owner\"); require(owner.send( address ( this ).balance) ); } \n\n // get all coffee function getAllCoffee( uint _id ) public view returns(BuyCoffee[] memory c ){ require(_id <= coffeeId, \"Non-existent id\"); c = new BuyCoffee[](_id); for( uint i = 0 ; i < _id; i++) { c[i] = idToBuyCoffee[i + 1 ]; } } } \n\n Make this page better \n\n\n#### Now that we have completed writing our BMC smart contract, the next step is to test the functionalities \n\n#### of our smart contract, deploy and interact with the smart contract on Kaia Testnet Kairos. \n\n## 3. Testing the contract’s functionalities using \n\n## scripts \n\n#### In this section, we will be writing scripts to test the functionality of our smart contract. To get started, \n\n#### navigate to your scripts folder, create a new file named bmc-sample.js and paste the following code in \n\n#### it: \n\n const hre = require(\"hardhat\"); // Logs the KAIA balances of a specific address. async function getBalance( address ) { const balanceBigInt = await hre.ethers.provider.getBalance(address); return hre.ethers.utils.formatEther(balanceBigInt) } \n\n // Logs the KAIA balances for a list of addresses. async function getBalances( addresses ) { let idx = 0 ; for (const address of addresses) { console.log(address ${idx} balances, await getBalance(address)); idx++; } } \n\n // Logs all the coffee info stored on-chain from coffee tx. async function getAllCoffee( memos ) { for (const memo of memos) { const timestamp = memo.timestamp; const sender = memo.sender; const name = memo.name; const message = memo.message console.log(At ${timestamp}, ${name}, with ${sender}, said: \"${message}\"); } } \n\n async function main() { const [owner, tipper1, tipper2, tipper3 ] = await hre.ethers.getSigners(); const BuyMeACoffee = await hre.ethers.getContractFactory(\"BuyMeACoffee\"); const buyMeACoffe = await BuyMeACoffee.deploy(); await buyMeACoffe.deployed(); console.log(BuyMeACoffee Contract Address, buyMeACoffe.address); // (========Check Balance==========) const addressses = [owner.address, tipper1.address, buyMeACoffe.address]; console.log(\"======GET BALANCE=======\"); await getBalances(addressses); // Buy Coffee for owner const tip = {value: hre.ethers.utils.parseEther(\" 1 \")} await buyMeACoffe.connect(tipper1).buyCoffee(\"Alice\", \"Hi Jude\", tip); await buyMeACoffe.connect(tipper2).buyCoffee(\"Bob\", \"Hi Alice\", tip); await buyMeACoffe.connect(tipper3).buyCoffee(\"Japhet\", \"Hi Ox\", tip);^ Make^ this^ page^ better \n\n\n#### As always, lets go over what each line of code does: \n\n#### You will notice that at the top of the code, there exist some helper functions for getting the balances of \n\n#### both a single address and multiple addresses. Also in the code exists the main function which houses \n\n#### the functionality of testing our smart contract. \n\n#### Let’s do a walk through of the code in the main() function. \n\n#### First we set the list of accounts (owner, tipper1, tipper2, tipper3) for test purposes by calling await \n\n##### hre.ethers.getSigners() \n\n#### Next we created a contract instance and deployed it. In this case the BuyMeACoffee.sol contract. \n\n#### Then, we set a list of addressees, checked their balances using the getBalances() function. We then \n\n#### called the buyCoffee function on three different instances. Next we checked each addresses balance \n\n#### after the coffee transaction. \n\n#### That said, we then called the withdraw function to withdraw all funds to the owner address. Next we \n\n#### checked the addresses balance after withdrawal. \n\n#### Finally, we got all the coffee transactions in the smart contract by calling the getAllCoffee() function. To \n\n#### see the script in action, run the command below: \n\n // check balance after tipping console.log(\"======GET BALANCE AFTER TIPPING=======\"); await getBalances(addressses); // withdraw coffee tips await buyMeACoffe.connect(owner).withdrawCoffeTips(); // check balance after withdrawing tip console.log(\"======GET BALANCE AFTER WITHDRAWING TIP=======\"); await getBalances(addressses); // get the current coffee tx id. const coffeeId = await buyMeACoffe.coffeeId() const id = coffeeId.toString(); console.log(coffeeId.toString()); // get all existing coffee tx const allCoffee = await buyMeACoffe.getAllCoffee(id); \n\n await getAllCoffee(allCoffee); } // We recommend this pattern to be able to use async/await everywhere // and properly handle errors. main().catch(( error ) => { console.error(error); process.exitCode = 1 ; }); \n\n npx hardhat run scripts/bmc-coffee.js \n\n Make this page better \n\n\n#### You should have an output in your terminal that looks like this: \n\n## 4.

To get started, create a new file (^) withdraw.js in your scripts folder and paste the code below: const hre = require(\"hardhat\"); // contract address of BMC Contract const buyMeACoffeAddress = \"Paste BMC contract address\"; // address of the contract deployer // useful when calling the withdrawCoffeTips() function // ensure that this address is the SAME address as the original contract deployer const deployerAddress = \"Paste deployer address\"; // get the balance of a specified address async function getBalance( _address_ ) { const balanceBigInt = await hre.ethers.provider.getBalance(address); return hre.ethers.utils.formatEther(balanceBigInt) } async function main() { // initialize the deployerAddress to a signer object // this will be useful when calling the withdrawCoffeTips() to the owner address const signer = await hre.ethers.getSigner(deployerAddress); // instantiate the BMC contract const BuyMeACoffee = await hre.ethers.getContractAt(\"BuyMeACoffee\", buyMeACoffeAddress, const balanceBefore = await getBalance(signer.address); const contractBalance = await getBalance(BuyMeACoffee.address); console.log(`Owner balance before withdrawing tips: ${balanceBefore} KAIA`); console.log(`Contract balance before withdrawing tips: ${contractBalance} KAIA`); // Withdraw funds if there are funds to withdraw. if (contractBalance !== \"0.0\") { console.log(\"withdrawing funds..\") const withdrawCoffeTxn = await BuyMeACoffee.withdrawCoffeTips(); await withdrawCoffeTxn.wait(); // check owner's balance after withdrawing coffee tips const balanceAfter = await getBalance(signer.address); console.log(`Owner balance after withdrawing tips ${balanceAfter} KAIA`); } else { console.log(\"no funds to withdraw!\"); } } // We recommend this pattern to be able to use async/await everywhere // and properly handle errors. main().catch(( _error_ ) => { console.error(error); process.exitCode = 1 ; }); Make this page better \n\n\n#### As you can see from the code above, having instantiated the BMC contract, the scripts will execute the \n\n#### withdrawCoffeTips function only when the contract balance is greater than zero. Makes sense right? \n\n#### Yes! In the event where the contract has no funds, it prints \"No funds to withdraw\" hence saving us \n\n#### some gas from contract invocation. \n\n#### To see this in action, lets run the script below: \n\n#### On successful execution of the scripts, your terminal should look like this: \n\n#### You can see from the output that the owner balance increased by 2 KAIA after withdrawing the coffee \n\n#### tips. \n\n#### Now that we have our contract deployed and all functionalities tested, it is time to build out the \n\n#### frontend. \n\n#### The frontend will bring the BMC functionality to live i.e we can now visualize how we interact with the \n\n#### BMC smart contract. \n\n## 5. Building the BMC Frontend with React and \n\n## Web3Onboard \n\n#### In this section, we will be building our dApp frontend website with Next.js and Web3Onbaord. To get \n\n#### started, you have to navigate to the frontend folder previously created. \n\n#### The next step is to install the necessary dependencies to get our BMC frontend website up and running. \n\n#### The following are the packages to be installed: \n\n#### 1. Web3Onboard packages: Web3-Onboard is a chain-agnostic wallet library that supports multi\n\n#### wallet compatibility in your dApp built on EVM-compatible networks like Kaia Blockchain. \n\n npx hardhat run scripts/withdraw.js --network kairos \n\n Ayomitans-MacBook-Pro:smart-contract oxpampam$ npx hardhat run scripts/withdraw.js --netw Owner balance before withdrawing tips: 155.8337532 KAIA Contract balance before withdrawing tips: 2.0 KAIA withdrawing funds.. Owner balance after withdrawing tips 157.83298835 KAIA \n\n cd .. cd frontend \n\n Make this page better \n\n\n#### 2. ethers.js: Web3-Onboard provider can be used with libraries like ethers.js andweb3.js. In this guide, \n\n#### we will use ethers.js to make Kaia blockchain calls like getting the user’s account, fetch balance, \n\n#### sign transaction, send transaction, read from and write to the smart contract. \n\n#### Important Note: We need to edit 2 files in the frontend/pages folder \n\n#### _app.js \n\n#### index.js \n\n### 5.1 Setting up Web3Onboard Provider and Wallet Modules \n\n#### Step 1 Installing @web3-onboard/react \n\nIn your (^) _app.js file, import the web3OnboardProvider and init function. More to be discussed later. \n\n#### Step 2 Installing and Instantiating Wallet Modules \n\n#### In this step, you can add as many wallets to be supported in your dApp using the wallet modules. But for \n\n#### this guide, you will add Coinbase Wallet, WalletConnect, Injected Wallets to your web3-Onboard \n\n#### implementation. \n\n#### In your _app.js file, import and instantiate the wallet modules to integrate with your dApp. Note that \n\n#### each module has its own unique options parameters to pass in, such as a fallback JSON RPC URL or \n\n#### default chain ID. \n\n#### Step 3 Installing ethers \n\n npm install @web3-onboard/react \n\n import { Web3OnboardProvider, init } from '@web3-onboard/react' \n\n npm install @web3-onboard/coinbase // Coinbase Wallet npm install @web3-onboard/walletconnect // WalletConnect npm install @web3-onboard/injected-wallets // Used to connect to Metamask \n\n import coinbaseWalletModule from \"@web3-onboard/coinbase\"; import walletConnectModule from \"@web3-onboard/walletconnect\"; import injectedModule from \"@web3-onboard/injected-wallets\"; const coinbaseWalletSdk = coinbaseWalletModule(); const walletConnect = walletConnectModule(); const injected = injectedModule(); const modules = [coinbaseWalletSdk, walletConnect, injected]; \n\n(^) Make this page better \n\n\n#### Step 4 Instantiating Web3Onboard using the Web3OnboardProvider \n\n#### Web3OnboardProvider provides a better way to manage global state. It simplifies wrapping the provider \n\n#### object around your App and the initialized Web3Onboard instance will be available in all children \n\n#### components. \n\n#### Init function initializes web3-Onboard and makes it available for all hooks to use. \n\nTo see this in action, paste the code below the previous code in your (^) _app.js file: npm install --save ethers const ETH_MAINNET_RPC_URL = `https://eth-mainnet.g.alchemy.com/v2/demo`; const KAIA_MAINNET_URL = `https://public-en.node.kaia.io`; const KAIROS_TESTNET_URL = `https://public-en-kairos.node.kaia.io`; const web3Onboard = init({ wallets: modules, chains: [ { id: \"0x1\", // chain ID must be in hexadecimal token: \"ETH\", namespace: \"evm\", label: \"Ethereum Mainnet\", rpcUrl: ETH_MAINNET_RPC_URL }, { id: \"0x2019\", // chain ID must be in hexadecimal token: \"KAIA\", namespace: \"evm\", label: \"Kaia Mainnet\", rpcUrl: KAIA_MAINNET_URL }, { id: \"0x3e9\", // chain ID must be in hexadecimel token: \"KAIA\", namespace: \"evm\", label: \"Kairos Testnet\", rpcUrl: KAIROS_TESTNET_URL }, // you can add as much supported chains as possible ], appMetadata: { name: \"Kaia-web3-onboard-App\", // change to your dApp name icon: \"paste your icon url\" logo: \"paste your logo url\" description: \"Web3Onboard-Kaia\", recommendedInjectedWallets: [ { name: \"Coinbase\", url: \"https://wallet.coinbase.com/\" }, { name: \"MetaMask\", url: \"https://metamask.io\" } ] } }) export default function App({ _Component_ , _pageProps_ }) {^ Make^ this^ page^ better \n\n\n#### Having set up our _app.js file which grants our App a provider object and web3Onboard instance \n\n#### available in all children components, next is to build out front-end logic in our index.js file \n\n#### Index.js \n\n#### This page handles wallet connection and sending of coffee to the BMC smart contract which is to be \n\n#### withdrawn by the contract deployer. \n\n return ( < Web3OnboardProvider web3Onboard ={web3Onboard}> < Component {...pageProps} /> </ Web3OnboardProvider > ) } \n\n import React, { useEffect, useState } from 'react'; import { useConnectWallet } from '@web3-onboard/react' import abi from \"../utils/BuyMeACoffee.json\" import { ethers } from \"ethers\"; \n\n export default function Home() { const [name, setName] = useState(\"\"); const [message, setMessage] = useState(\"\"); const [coffee, setGetCoffee] = useState([]); const [coffeeContract, setCoffeeContract] = useState(); const [{ wallet, connecting }, connect, disconnect] = useConnectWallet(); const contractAddress = \"Paste BMC contract address\"; const contractABI = abi.abi; const getCoffee = async () => { try { console.log(\"getting coffee Id\") const coffeeId = await coffeeContract.coffeeId(); console.log(coffeeId.toString()); const getCoffee = await coffeeContract.getAllCoffee(coffeeId.toString()); setGetCoffee(getCoffee); } catch (error) { console.log(error); } }; useEffect(() => { let ethersProvider if (wallet) { ethersProvider = new ethers.BrowserProvider(wallet.provider, 'any') } \n\n if (ethersProvider) { try { const getCoffeContract = async () => { const signer = await ethersProvider.getSigner(); \n\n const buyMeACoffee = new ethers.Contract(contractAddress, contractABI, signer); \n\n setCoffeeContract(buyMeACoffee) }^ Make^ this^ page^ better \n\n\ngetCoffeContract(); } catch (error) { console.log(error); } } }, [wallet]) useEffect(() => { const onNewCoffee = ( _from_ , _timestamp_ , _name_ , _message_ ) => { console.log(\"Coffee received: \", from, timestamp, name, message); setGetCoffee(( _prevState_ ) => [ ...prevState, { address: from, timestamp: **new** Date(timestamp * 1000 ), message, name } ]); }; if (wallet && coffeeContract) { getCoffee() coffeeContract.on(\"NewCoffee\", onNewCoffee); } else { console.log(\"provider not initialized yet\"); } }, [wallet, coffeeContract]) const onNameChange = ( _event_ ) => { setName(event.target.value); } const onMessageChange = ( _event_ ) => { setMessage(event.target.value); } const buyCoffee = async ( _e_ ) => { e.preventDefault(); try { if (!wallet && !coffeeContract) { console.log(\"provider not initialized yet\"); return; } console.log(\"buying coffee..\") const coffeeTxn = await coffeeContract.buyCoffee(name, message, {value: ethers.pa const coffeTx = await coffeeTxn.wait(); console.log(\"mined \", coffeTx.hash); console.log(\"coffee sent!\"); // clear target value fields e.target.inputName.value = \"\"; e.target.inputAmount.value = \"\"; // Clear the form fields. setName(\"\"); setMessage(\"\"); // set all coffees await getCoffee(); } catch (error) { console.log(error); } }; \n\nreturn ( <main _className_ ='coffeeMain max-w-8xl min-h-[100vh] p-10 bg-black Makemt-0^ thisshadow-2xl^ page^ better m\n\n\n### Important notes from the code above \n\n#### 1.

    " Tutorials Build a dApp using Scaffold-ETH 2 \n\n# Build a dApp using Scaffold-ETH \n\n# 2 \n\n## Introduction \n\nScaffold-ETH 2 is an open-source toolkit for building decentralized applications (dApps) on Ethereum and other EVM-compatible blockchains, like Kaia. Developers can easily deploy a Solidity smart contract and launch a dApp with a React frontend thanks to Scaffold-ETH 2. \n\nThe Scaffold-ETH 2 toolkit was built using Next.js, RainbowKit, Hardhat, Foundry, Wagmi, and TypeScript. Developers can easily create, test, and deploy smart contracts using Hardhat or Foundry, as well as build a React frontend using Next.js. \n\nIn this tutorial, you will learn how to deploy, run a contract and build a dApp on Kaia using Scaffold-ETH 2. \n\n## Prerequisites \n\nTo get started with in this guide, you will need: \n\n Node (>= v18.17) Yarn (v1 or v2+) Familiarity with Javascript and React basics such as hooks Metamask Wallet Test KAIA from Faucet RPC Endpoint: you can obtain this from one of the supported endpoint providersMake this page better \n\n\n## Setting up development environment \n\nTo install Scaffold-ETH 2, you have two options, either to install by cloning Scaffold-ETH 2 repository or by using npx create-eth@latest. \n\nFor the sake of this guide, we will use the npx method to bootstrap our Scaffold-ETH 2 project. \n\nBootstrap a Scaffold-ETH 2 project by running the command below: \n\nYou will be presented with a series of prompts: \n\n**Project Name** : Input your project name: Enter a name for your project, e.g., kaia-scaffold-example. \n\n**Solidity Framework** ; What solidity framework do you want to use?: Choose your preferred solidity framework (Hardhat, Foundry). For this guide, we will use the Hardhat framework. \n\n**Install packages?** : Press Enter for yes (default option) or type n and press Enter for no Once the setup is complete, navigate to the project directory. \n\n## Highlight of the development process with \n\n## Scaffold-ETH 2 \n\nThe process for developing a project with Scaffold-ETH 2 can be outlined as follows: \n\n1. Update the network configurations in Hardhat for Kaia \n\n npx create-eth@latest \n\n cd project-name // e.g cd kaia_scaffold \n\n(^) Make this page better \n\n\n2. Add your smart contracts to the **packages/hardhat/contracts** \n\n3. Edit your deployment scripts in the **packages/hardhat/deploy** \n\n4. Deploy your smart contracts to Kaia \n\n5. Verify your smart contracts with hardhat verify plugin \n\n6. Configure your frontend to target Kaia in the **packages/nextjs/scaffold.config.ts** file \n\n7. Edit your frontend as needed in the **packages/nextjs/pages** directory \n\nFor the sake of this guide, we’ll use the default sample contract and frontend available after ScaffoldETH 2 installation. All that is required is to modify these components for Kaia. In that case, we’ll split the configurations into **Hardhat** and **Next.js** configurations. \n\n## Hardhat Configuration \n\nIn this section, you’ll modify the network configurations in the Hardhat configuration file to target Kaia under the **packages/hardhat** folder. \n\n### Configure Hardhat for Kaia \n\nTo configure hardhat for Kaia, you need to create a .env file and also modify hardhat.config.ts to support Kaia. \n\n**Step 1: Create .env** \n\nTo create .env file, copy and paste the code below in your terminal \n\nYou can refer to the **.env.example** file for the variables that are already used in the hardhat.config.js file. For Kaia, you’ll only need to create one variable: **DEPLOYED_PRIVATE_KEY**. \n\n**Step 2: Edit your .env file to include this variable:** \n\nThe private key stated in your **.env** file corresponds to the account that will deploy and interact with the smart contracts in your Hardhat project. \n\n**Step 3: Modify hardhat.config.ts** \n\nThe next thing we want to do is to configure **hardhat.config.ts** to support Kaia. \n\n touch packages/hardhat/.env \n\n DEPLOYER_PRIVATE_KEY=INSERT_PRIVATE_KEY \n\n Make this page better \n\n\nSet the constant **defaultNetwork** to the network you are deploying the smart contract to. \n\nAdd the network configurations for Kaia under the networks configuration object \n\nFor more information on using Hardhat with Kaia, please check Hardhat guide for more details. \n\n### Deploy Contract to Kaia \n\nAfter configuring Hardhat to support the Kaia network, the next step is to compile and deploy the sample contract. \n\nFirst, you can compile your contract by running: \n\nThen, you can run the following command from the root directory of your project: \n\nNote: \n\n If you did not set the defaultNetwork config in the hardhat.config.ts file, you can append --network INSERT_NETWORK to the command. For example, the following command would deploy a contract to Kaia. \n\n yarn deploy --network kaia \n\n kairos: { chainId: 1001 , url: \"https://responsive-green-emerald.kaia-kairos.quiknode.pro/\", accounts: [deployerPrivateKey], }, \n\n network: \"kairos\", \n\n yarn compile \n\n yarn deploy \n\n Make this page better \n\n\n### Verify Your Deployed Contract \n\nTo verify our already deployed contract, we'll use the hardhat verify plugin. All that is required is to add the following configuration to your **hardhat.config.ts** under the etherscan configuration object for Kairos Testnet. \n\nNext is to copy and paste the following command in your terminal to verify the smart contract: \n\nExample \n\nActual \n\nAs you can see above, to verify your contracts, you have to pass in the network name, contract address and constructor arguments (if any). After a short wait, the console will display the verification result and, if successful, the URL to the verified contract on Kaiascope will be provided. \n\n etherscan: { apiKey: { kairos: \"unnecessary\", }, customChains: [ { network: \"kairos\", chainId: 1001 , urls: { apiURL: \"https://api-baobab.klaytnscope.com/api\", browserURL: \"https://kairos.kaiascope.com\", }, }, ], }, \n\n yarn hardhat-verify --network network_name contract_address \"Constructor arg 1 \" \n\n yarn hardhat-verify --network kairos 0x7fc9656fc8c8ab433867e58b7c6afc19ec4275da \"0x7fc9656fc8c8ab433867e58b7c6afc19ec4275da\" \n\n Make this page better \n\n\nFor more information about verifying smart contracts on Kaia using the Hardhat Verify plugin, please refer to the Hardhat-Verify-Plugins guide. \n\n## Next.js Configuration \n\nIn this section, you’ll modify the Next.js configuration to target Kairos Testnet (where the smart contract was deployed to) under the **packages/nextjs** folder. In this folder, we intend to modify the **targetNetwork** array in the scaffoldConfig object in **scaffold.config.ts** file. \n\n### Modify the targetNetwork array \n\nThat’s all required to configure Next.js! Next, is to launch the dApp in your localhost. \n\n### Launch the dApp in your Localhost \n\nAfter making all the necessary configurations, you can now launch the example dApp on your localhost. \n\nTo do so, run: \n\n targetNetworks: [chains.klaytnBaobab], \n\n yarn start \n\n Make this page better \n\n\nYou should now be able to access a React-based dApp frontend at [http://localhost:3001/.](http://localhost:3001/.)

    " Advanced Topics Transaction Execution Computation Cost \n\n# Computation Cost \n\nSince Kaia aims to maintain 1-second block time, the execution time of transactions has to be managed. Here are three approaches to achieve that: \n\n1. Limiting the gas limit of a transaction \n\n2. Limiting the execution time of a transaction \n\n3. Limiting the computation cost of a transaction \n\nLimiting the gas limit of a transaction was not a feasible solution because the concept of the gas represents the current exchange value of the various resources in the blockchain platform such as computation, storage, network bandwidth, and so on. It is not suitable as a metric for the transaction execution time. \n\nLimiting the execution time of a transaction was not feasible either because the execution time can vary between nodes on the blockchain platform. For example, consider the case in which we limit the execution time of a transaction to be 100 milli-second. If a node executes a transaction in 90 ms and another node executes it in 110 ms, the two nodes cannot reach a consensus. Hence, this solution is not appropriate. \n\nThe last approach is to limit the computation cost of a transaction. We modelled the computation cost of each EVM opcode based on its actual execution time and limit the sum of computation cost of a transaction. With this approach, we eliminate other factors and only count the normalized execution time unit, and nodes can reach a consensus as well. \n\nTherefore, we chose the third option for Kaia. The computation cost limit was 100,000,000, but as CPU computing performance has increased, the limit has been raised to 150,000,000 after Cancun EVM hardfork. This limit value is determined by the platform, so the developers should be aware of the computation cost of a transaction. To calculate the computation cost of a transaction, Kaia provides kaia_estimateComputationCost. The usage is almost the same as kaia_estimateGas. \n\n NOTE Computation cost related hardfork changes can be found at the bottom of this page. Go to Hardfork Changes. \n\n## Computation Cost Limit \n\n\nA series of opcodes or precompiled contracts are executed sequentially when executing a transaction. To limit the execution time of a transaction, we have made a deterministic execution time calculation model for opcodes and precompiled contracts based on real execution time. \n\nBased on this model, predetermined computation cost values for opcodes and precompiled contracts are added to the total computation cost. If the total value exceeds computation cost limit, transaction execution is aborted and returns ComputationCostLimitReached(0x0a) error. \n\nWhen setting the computation cost limit value, we set --opcode-computation-cost-limit flag value as a limit if it is set as a non-zero value. If it’s zero, the limit is set to the default computation cost limit defined for each specific hardfork. Exceptionally, the limit for call/estimateGas/estimateComputationCost is always set to unlimited and is not influenced by flag or hardfork values. However, execution still can be aborted due to other limits such as gas cap. \n\n## Computation Cost of Opcodes \n\nThe below table shows the computation cost of EVM opcodes. The computation cost was determined based on experiments. \n\n Opcode ComputationCost \n\n STOP 0 \n\n ADD 150 \n\n MUL 200 \n\n SUB 219 \n\n DIV 404 \n\n SDIV 360 \n\n MOD 320 \n\n SMOD 560 \n\n ADDMOD 360 \n\n MULMOD 700 \n\n EXP 720 Make^ this^ page^ better \n\n\n**Opcode ComputationCost** \n\nSIGNEXTEND 481 \n\nLT 201 \n\nGT 264 \n\nSLT 176 \n\nSGT 222 \n\nEQ 220 \n\nISZERO 165 \n\nAND 288 \n\nOR 160 \n\nXOR 454 \n\nNOT 364 \n\nBYTE 589 \n\nSHL 478 \n\nSHR 498 \n\nSAR 834 \n\nSHA3 560 \n\nADDRESS 284 \n\nBALANCE 1407 \n\nORIGIN 210 \n\nCALLER 188 \n\n\n**Opcode ComputationCost** \n\nCALLVALUE 149 \n\nCALLDATALOAD 596 \n\nCALLDATASIZE 194 \n\nCALLDATACOPY 100 \n\nCODESIZE 145 \n\nCODECOPY 898 \n\nGASPRICE 131 \n\nEXTCODESIZE 1481 \n\nEXTCODECOPY 1000 \n\nRETURNDATASIZE 10 \n\nRETURNDATACOPY 40 \n\nEXTCODEHASH 1000 \n\nBLOCKHASH 500 \n\nCOINBASE 189 \n\nTIMESTAMP 265 \n\nNUMBER 202 \n\nPREVRANDAO 1498 \n\nGASLIMIT 166 \n\nCHAINID 120 \n\nSELFBALANCE 374 \n\n\n**Opcode ComputationCost** \n\nPOP 140 \n\nMLOAD 376 \n\nMSTORE 288 \n\nMSTORE8 230 \n\nSLOAD 2550 \n\nSSTORE 2510 \n\nJUMP 253 \n\nJUMPI 176 \n\nPC 147 \n\nMSIZE 137 \n\nGAS 230 \n\nJUMPDEST 10 \n\nPUSH0 80 \n\nPUSH1 120 \n\nPUSH2 120 \n\nPUSH3 120 \n\nPUSH4 120 \n\nPUSH5 120 \n\nPUSH6 120 \n\nPUSH7 120 \n\n\n**Opcode ComputationCost** \n\nPUSH8 120 \n\nPUSH9 120 \n\nPUSH10 120 \n\nPUSH11 120 \n\nPUSH12 120 \n\nPUSH13 120 \n\nPUSH14 120 \n\nPUSH15 120 \n\nPUSH16 120 \n\nPUSH17 120 \n\nPUSH18 120 \n\nPUSH19 120 \n\nPUSH20 120 \n\nPUSH21 120 \n\nPUSH22 120 \n\nPUSH23 120 \n\nPUSH24 120 \n\nPUSH25 120 \n\nPUSH26 120 \n\nPUSH27 120 \n\n\n**Opcode ComputationCost** \n\nPUSH28 120 \n\nPUSH29 120 \n\nPUSH30 120 \n\nPUSH31 120 \n\nPUSH32 120 \n\nDUP1 190 \n\nDUP2 190 \n\nDUP3 176 \n\nDUP4 142 \n\nDUP5 177 \n\nDUP6 165 \n\nDUP7 147 \n\nDUP8 157 \n\nDUP9 138 \n\nDUP10 174 \n\nDUP11 141 \n\nDUP12 144 \n\nDUP13 157 \n\nDUP14 143 \n\nDUP15 237 \n\n\n**Opcode ComputationCost** \n\nDUP16 149 \n\nSWAP1 141 \n\nSWAP2 156 \n\nSWAP3 145 \n\nSWAP4 135 \n\nSWAP5 115 \n\nSWAP6 146 \n\nSWAP7 199 \n\nSWAP8 130 \n\nSWAP9 160 \n\nSWAP10 134 \n\nSWAP11 147 \n\nSWAP12 128 \n\nSWAP13 121 \n\nSWAP14 114 \n\nSWAP15 197 \n\nSWAP16 128 \n\nLOG0 100 \n\nLOG1 500 \n\nLOG2 500 \n\n\n**Opcode ComputationCost** \n\nLOG3 500 \n\nLOG4 500 \n\nPUSH 0 \n\nDUP 0 \n\nSWAP 0 \n\nCREATE 2094 \n\nCALL 5000 \n\nCALLCODE 4000 \n\nRETURN 0 \n\nDELEGATECALL 696 \n\nCREATE2 10000 \n\nSTATICCALL 10000 \n\nREVERT 0 \n\nSELFDESTRUCT 0 \n\nBASEFEE 198 \n\nBLOBBASEFEE 120 \n\nBLOBHASH 165 \n\nTSTORE 280 \n\nTLOAD 220 \n\nMCOPY 250 \n\n\n## Precompiled contracts computation cost table \n\n Input is a byte array input of a precompiled contract. \n\n Address Precompiled contracts Computation Cost \n\n 0x01 ecrecover 113,150 \n\n 0x02 sha256hash numOfWords(input) / 32 * 100 + 1,000 \n\n 0x03 ripemd160hash numOfWords(input) / 32 * 10 + 100 \n\n 0x04 dataCopy 0 \n\n 0x05 bigModExp see the code here \n\n 0x06 bn256Add 8,000 \n\n 0x07 bn256ScalarMul 100,000 \n\n 0x08 bn256Pairing numOfPairings(input) * 1,000,000 + 2,000,000 \n\n 0x09 blake2f bigEndian(getRounds(input[0:4])) * 10 + 10,000 \n\n 0x0A kzg 2,200,000 \n\n 0x3FD vmLog 10 \n\n 0x3FE feePayer 10 \n\n 0x3FF validateSender numOfSigs(input) * 180,000 + 10,000 \n\n## Hardfork Changes \n\n Hardfork New items Changes \n\n Cancun EVM BLOBBASEFEE (0x49) BLOBHASH (0x50) TSTORE (0x5c) opcode TLOAD (0x5d) \n\n increase the computation cost limit from 100,000,000 to 150,000,000 \n\n reduce the computation cost of someMake this page better \n\n\n Hardfork New items Changes MCOPY (0x5e) kzg (0x0a) precompiled contract \n\n opcodes due to cpu performance increase -Sdiv (0x05): 739 -> 360 -Mod (0x06): 812 -> 320 -Addmod (0x08): 1410 -> 360 -Mulmod (0x09): 1760 -> 700 -Exp (0x0A): 5000 -> 720 -Sha3 (0x20): 2465 -> 560 -Mstore8 (0x53): 5142 -> 230 -Log1, Log2, Log3, Log4 (0xA1-0xA4): 1000 -> 500 \n\n increase the computation cost of some opcodes due to increased database size -SLOAD (0x54): 835 -> 2550 -SSTORE (0x55): 1548 -> 2510 \n\n Shanghai EVM PUSH0 (0x5f) opcode \n\n Kore \n\n modExp (0x05) precompiled contract use new gas calculation logic.

    " Service Chain Quick Start Configure high availability \n\n# Configure high availability \n\n### If only one bridge is used in the ServiceChain, that bridge can become a single point of failure. To solve \n\n### this, we describe how you can build an HA system with two or more bridges. As shown in the figure \n\n### below, configure the bridges to be connected in at least two pairs, so that even if there is a problem in \n\n### one bridge connection, data anchoring and value transfer between chains can still work normally \n\n### through the other bridge. \n\n## Prerequisites \n\n\n### The main bridge of the EN and the sub bridge of the SCN are connected. If it’s not, please refer to \n\n### Kairos connection to establish the connection. \n\n### This section describes how to add an extra bridge between Kairos and a ServiceChain. In the same \n\n### way, you can also set up HA by adding another bridge. \n\n## Step 1: Adding another Bridge between EN-SCN \n\n### In Connecting to Kairos, we assume that the EN and the SCN connected by a bridge as EN-01 and SCN\n\n### L2-01, respectively. In this section, we will add another bridge between EN-02 and SCN-L2-02. Since it \n\n### follows the same procedure, we will briefly explain. \n\nAfter building EN-02, set (^) SC_MAIN_BRIDGE to 1 in (^) conf/kend.conf and restart ken on EN-02. \n\n#### SC_MAIN_BRIDGE= 1 \n\n\n### Check the KNI information of EN-02 by the following command: \n\nLog in to SCN-L2-02, and create (^) main-bridges.json with the KNI of EN-02. Please make sure that it \n\n### should be in the JSON array format with a square bracket. \n\nOn the shell of SCN-L2-02, edit (^) kscn-XXXXX-amd64/conf/kscnd.conf as described below. To connect \n\n### a bridge, set SC_SUB_BRIDGE to 1. SC_PARENT_CHAIN_ID is set to Kairos’s chainID 1001. \n\n### SC_ANCHORING_PERIOD is the parameter that decides the period to send an anchoring transaction to \n\n### the parent chain. In this example, an anchor transaction is submitted to the parent chain (Kairos) for \n\n### every 10 child blocks. \n\n### If you restart ken on EN-02, a bridge will be connected automatically between the EN-02 and the SCN\n\n### L2-02 and data anchoring will start from the point where the connection is made as shown in the figure \n\n### below. \n\n### After adding the bridge between EN-02 and SCN-L2-02, you can now see the connection between the \n\n### nodes are established as shown in below. \n\n EN-02$ ken attach --datadir ~/data > mainbridge.nodeInfo.kni \"kni://eb8f21df10c6562...25bae@[::]:50505?discport=0\" \n\n SCN-L2-02$ echo '[\"kni://eb8f21df10c6562...25bae@192.168.0.5:50505?discport=0\"]' > ~/data \n\n#### ... \n\n#### SC_SUB_BRIDGE=1 \n\n#### ... \n\n#### SC_PARENT_CHAIN_ID=1001 \n\n#### ... \n\n#### SC_ANCHORING_PERIOD=10 \n\n#### ... \n\n\n## Step 2: Registering and Subscribing the Bridge \n\n## Contract \n\n### As shown in the figure above, the bridge contract is registered only in EN-01 and SCN-L2-01. \n\n### Connect to the SCN-L2-02 console and run the APIs for bridge registration, bridge subscription, and \n\n### token registration. The bridge and token contract were created while deploying the bridge contract with \n\n### EN-01 and SCN-L2-01 in step 2 of Cross-Chain Value Transfer. \n\n $ kscn attach --datadir ~/data > subbridge.registerBridge(\"0xCHILD_BRIDGE_ADDR\", \"0xPARENT_BRIDGE_ADDR\") null > subbridge.subscribeBridge(\"0xCHILD_BRIDGE_ADDR\", \"0xPARENT_BRIDGE_ADDR\") null > subbridge.registerToken(\"0xCHILD_BRIDGE_ADDR\", \"0xPARENT_BRIDGE_ADDR\", \"0xCHILD_TOKEN_A null \n\n\n### In the bridge contract, information about adding an extra bridge should be updated. Write the child \n\n### operator and parent operator information of the added extra bridge in the erc20/erc20\n\n### addOperator4HA.js file of service-chain-value-transfer-example and execute node erc20\n\n### addOperator4HA.js. \n\n### When there are multiple bridges, value transfer can be provided more safely by setting a threshold. \n\n### Value transfer can be enabled only when an operator above the threshold normally requests value \n\n### transfer. For example, as in the current example, if there are two bridge pairs and the threshold is set to \n\n### 2, value transfer can be provided only when both are normally requested. That is, even if one bridge is \n\n### attacked and sends an abnormal request, it can be prevented. The default value of threshold is 1. In the \n\n### erc20/erc20-addOperator4HA.js file of service-chain-value-transfer-example, uncomment the \n\n### code below and set the threshold value and then run it to change the threshold for the bridge contract. \n\n### When registration is completed, a bridge contract is registered in both EN-02 and SCN-L2-02 as shown \n\n### in the figure below to configure HA. \n\n // register operator await conf.child.newInstanceBridge.methods.registerOperator(\"0xCHILD_BRIDGE_ADDR\").send({ await conf.parent.newInstanceBridge.methods.registerOperator(\"0xPARENT_BRIDGE_ADDR\").send \n\n // // set threshold // await conf.child.newInstanceBridge.methods.setOperatorThreshold(0, \"your threshold num // await conf.parent.newInstanceBridge.methods.setOperatorThreshold(0, \"your threshold nu \n\n\n### When two or more bridge pairs are connected for HA, data anchoring transactions for the same block \n\n### occur more than once, and value transfer transactions can also occur multiple times. That is, additional \n\n### fees are required. \n\n### Edit this page \n\nLast updated on **Jan 24, 2025** \n\n### Is this page helpful? \n\n\n",
    " Node Quick Reference Configure Node Monitoring \n\n# Configure Node Monitoring \n\n#### This guide explains how to set up Prometheus and Grafana to monitor your Kaia node. \n\n## 1. Metric Configuration in Kaia \n\n#### Kaia provides the following flags for metric export: \n\n#### --metric : Enables metric recording. This flag is typically used in conjunction with the -\n\n#### prometheus flag. \n\n#### --prometheus : Enables exporting recorded metrics to a Prometheus server. This flag is typically \n\n#### used in conjunction with the --metric flag. \n\n--prometheusport (^) : Specifies the port for Prometheus metrics. Defaults to 61001. \n\n#### To enable metrics and Prometheus exporting, set both METRICS and PROMETHEUS to 1 in your .conf \n\n#### file: \n\n## 2.

    " Service Chain Quick Start Connect to Kairos \n\n# Connect to Kairos \n\n#### This section covers how to connect your 4-node ServiceChain network to the Kairos network. You will \n\n#### set up a Kairos EN and connect the EN with one of your SCNs. Then you will enable the anchoring feature \n\n#### to put ServiceChain block information onto the Kairos network. \n\n## Prerequisites \n\n#### 1 Linux or MacOS server for EN \n\n#### Minimum hardware requirements for testing \n\n#### CPU: 4-core (Intel Xeon or equivalent), RAM: 16GB, HDD: 50GB \n\n#### Please refer to the System Requirements for more explanation. \n\n#### Download the Kairos EN executable. For the full list of downloadable binaries, see Download. \n\n#### Assumptions and Limitations \n\n#### A ServiceChain network is installed and running. Please refer to Setting up a 4-node Service \n\n#### Chain to setup a network. \n\n#### A Kairos EN. \n\n#### One EN can only connect to one SCN since only one-to-one connection is supported. \n\n#### Every SCN does not have to connect to the EN. \n\n Make this page better \n\n\n## Step 0: Install Kairos EN \n\n#### The installation is the uncompression of the downloaded package. Extract the archive on the EN server. \n\n## Step 1: Preparing genesis.json \n\n#### From the EN server, download the genesis.json for Kairos network. \n\n## Step 2: EN Node Initialization \n\n#### Now, we will initialize the EN node using the genesis file. Execute the following command. It will create \n\n#### the data folder storing the chain data and logs on your home directory. You can change the data folder \n\nusing the (^) --datadir directive. \n\n## Step 3: Configure the EN Node \n\n#### Go to the ken installation folder and rename mv kend_baobab.conf kend.conf , then edit \n\n#### conf/kend.conf as follows. \n\n## Step 4: Start the EN Node \n\n EN-01$ tar xvf ken-baobab-vX.X.X-XXXXX-amd64.tar.gz \n\n EN-01$ curl -X GET https://packages.kaia.io/kairos/genesis.json -o ~/genesis.json \n\n EN-01$ ken init --datadir ~/data ~/genesis.json \n\n##### ... \n\n NETWORK=\"baobab\" ... SC_MAIN_BRIDGE=1 ... DATA_DIR=~/data ... \n\n EN-01$ kend start Starting kscnd: OK \n\n Make this page better \n\n\n#### You can check block sync status by watching kaia.blockNumber. If this number is not 0, the node is \n\n#### working fine. Downloading all blocks on the Kairos network may take a long time depending on network \n\n#### conditions and hardware performance, so we recommend using Fast Sync to synchronize blocks. \n\n#### If you want to stop a node, you can use the command kend stop \n\n## Step 5: Check KNI of EN Node \n\n#### Take note of EN-01’s KNI which is the information used to connect from an SCN-L2-01 node. This value \n\n#### will be used in the next step when generating main-bridges.json. \n\n## Step 6: Create main-bridges.json \n\n#### Log on to an SCN-L2-01 (note: not the EN-01 node) and create main-bridges.json on ~/data. \n\n#### Replace [::] located after @ letter with EN-01 node’s IP address. \n\n EN-01$ ken attach --datadir ~/data > kaia.blockNumber 21073 \n\n EN-01$ ken attach --datadir ~/data > mainbridge.nodeInfo.kni \"kni://0f7aa6499553...25bae@[::]:50505?discport=0\" \n\n Make this page better \n\n\n## Step 7: Configure SCN then Restart kscn \n\nFrom the SCN-L2-01 node’s shell, edit (^) kscn-XXXXX-amd64/conf/kscnd.conf. If (^) SC_SUB_BRIDGE is set \n\n#### to 1, data anchoring starts automatically when the SCN-L2-01 node starts. In this example, \n\nSC_PARENT_CHAIN_ID (^) is set to 1001 because the chainID (^) of the parent chain, Kairos, is 1001. \n\n#### SC_ANCHORING_PERIOD is the parameter that decides the period to send an anchoring tx to the main \n\n#### chain. By setting the value to 10, you configure the node to perform anchoring every 10 blocks. The \n\n#### default value is 1. \n\n#### Restart kscn by executing the following command: \n\nCheck if the SCN-L2-01 is connected to the EN-01 by checking (^) subbridge.peers.length \n\n## Anchoring \n\n#### After finishing the EN-01 and SCN-L2-01 connection, you can log ServiceChain block information on the \n\n#### parent chain via Anchoring. In this section, you will top up a parent operator account, enable Anchoring, \n\n#### and check the anchored block number. \n\n### Step 1: Get KAIA to test anchoring \n\n SCN-L2-01$ echo '[\"kni://0f7aa6499553...25bae@192.168.1.1:50505?discport=0\"]' > ~/data/ma \n\n##### ... \n\n##### SC_SUB_BRIDGE=1 \n\n##### ... \n\n##### SC_PARENT_CHAIN_ID=1001 \n\n##### ... \n\n##### SC_ANCHORING_PERIOD=10 \n\n##### ... \n\n SCN-L2-01$ kscnd stop Shutting down kscnd: Killed SCN-L2-01$ kscnd start Starting kscnd: OK \n\n SCN-L2-01$ kscn attach --datadir ~/data > subbridge.peers.length 1 \n\n Make this page better \n\n\n#### Anchoring requires SCN-L2-01 to make an anchoring transaction to Kairos. So \n\n#### subbridge.parentOperator account should have enough KAIA to pay the transaction fee. Get some \n\n#### KAIA from Kairos Faucet and transfer some KAIA to the parentOperator. For data anchoring in real \n\n#### service, parentOperator needs to have enough KAIA for transaction fee. \n\n### Step 2: Start Anchoring \n\n#### To start anchoring, execute the following command: \n\n#### After anchoring starts, you can check the latest block anchored to Kairos by using \n\n#### subbridge.latestAnchoredBlockNumber. Please note that this only works after the EN already \n\n#### followed up on the latest block of Kairos. By default, SCN-L2-01 tries anchoring on every block from the \n\n#### block on which anchoring is turned on. The anchoring period can be set by changing \n\n#### SC_ANCHORING_PERIOD. If the value is set to 10, the node tries anchoring when the block number is a \n\n#### multiple of 10. \n\n SCN-L2-01$ kscn attach --datadir ~/data > subbridge.parentOperator \"0x3ce216beeafc62d20547376396e89528e1d778ca\" \n\n SCN-L2-01$ kscn attach --datadir ~/data > subbridge.anchoring(true) true \n\n SCN-L2-01$ kscn attach --datadir ~/data > subbridge.latestAnchoredBlockNumber Make this page better \n\n\n#### Edit this page \n\nLast updated on **Jan 24, 2025** \n\n#### Is this page helpful? \n\n##### 100 \n\n Make this page better \n\n\n",

    " Tutorials Connecting MetaMask to Kaia \n\n# Connect MetaMask to Kaia \n\n Note : MetaMask is mostly used as a wallet for Ethereum, but it is also compatible with Kaia due to the identical address structures. Kaia also has a browser extension wallet called Kaia Wallet, so it basically provides the same features as MetaMask, except for Remix. \n\n## Step 1. Install MetaMask \n\n We will be using Chrome browser in this example. ( Install Chrome ) \n\n Add MetaMask Extension to Chrome. \n\n Note: You may need additional installations if you are using another browser. \n\n You can start MetaMask by clicking on the icon in the upper right-hand corner of your chrome browser. \n\n## Step 2. Generate a MetaMask Wallet \n\n\nClick on [Create a Wallet]. \n\nSet a password. \n\nYou will be given a 12 word seed phrase; back it up somewhere secure. \n\n Note: You can only restore your wallet with the seed phrase. Sharing your seed phrase with others may result in losing all of your funds. Therefore, it is recommended that you either write it down manually or store it in an offline device. \n\n\n## Step 3. Connect to Kaia Network \n\n### A. Quick Configuration \n\n Kaia Mainnet Kaia Kairos Testnet \n\nUse ChainList for a one-click configuration and follow the instructions. \n\n### B. Manual Configuration \n\n1. Click on the upper Networks tab, which is on Ethereum Mainnet as default, and select [Add     network]. \n\n\n2. Enter the following Kaia network details in the **Add a network manually** page and click **Save** \n\n Kaia Mainnet Kaia Kairos Testnet \n\n Name \n\n Kaia Mainnet \n\n RPC \n\n https://public-en.node.kaia.io \n\n ID \n\n 8217 \n\n Symbol \n\n KAIA \n\n Explorer \n\n https://kaiascan.io \n\n\n## Step 4. Send KAIA \n\n**Note:** The following steps require KAIA. For this guide, we will be using Kairos Testnet. You can obtain Test KAIA in **Kaia Faucet**. \n\n Click [Send] on the main page and enter the recipient address and the amount of KAIA. \n\n**NOTE:** Sending KAIA is a payment transaction, for which you need KAIA. \n\n Since Kaia v1.9.0, a dynamic gas fee mechanism has replaced the existing fixed price policy. So you don’t have to set the fixed gas fee manually. Check the amount to send and the transaction fee and click [Confirm] to complete the KAIA transfer, after which you will be redirected to the main page. Click [Activity] on the main page to confirm the transaction history. \n\n\nEdit this page Last updated on **Jan 24, 2025** \n\n Is this page helpful? \n\n\n",
    " Core Concepts Consensus Mechanism \n\n# Consensus Mechanism \n\nA consensus mechanism (algorithm) is a way of reaching a consensus between trustless entities. In blockchain technology, it is used to reach a consensus about if a block is valid or not. The performance of blockchain networks relies on the performance of the adopted consensus mechanisms, and it has a significant impact on the perceived usability of the Blockchain Applications. \n\nKaia Mainnet exhibits the following performance. \n\n Handles 4,000 transactions per second. Immediate transaction finality. One-second block generation time. Over 50 consensus nodes can participate in the consensus process. \n\nIn the document, we will go over how Kaia implemented the high-performing consensus process. \n\n## Background \n\nBitcoin is using PoW (Proof-of-Work), whereas Ethereum has recently shifted to PoS (Proof-of-Stake), which decides on the block generating nodes by the stake of the node. Usually, these algorithms involve no communication between nodes in determining the validities of blocks. \n\nSo in these systems, a fork can happen which means two or more different blocks can be made on the same height. Usually, the \"Longest chain wins\" rule is applied to solve the fork condition. It means that those forks will be merged into a single canonical chain eventually, but it also means a list of blocks can be reverted in some period of time when it belongs to the shorter chain. So in these algorithms, there is no guarantee of the finality of blocks and transactions. The finality can only be achieved probabilistically after a period of time, which is still can’t be 100% guaranteed. \n\nThis lack of finality is a very difficult issue in customer-facing services that use blockchain platforms. Because it has to wait until forks are resolved and enough blocks are stacked after the transfer to believe the transaction is not reversible. This has a negative effect both on users and service providers. \n\nA simple example of this issue can be demonstrated in financial services. Say a user transferred money to someone, and the service can’t verify that the transfer is valid until 30 to 60 minutes have passed. Because it has to wait until the forks have been merged into a single chain and several blocks are stacked after the transfer to be sure that the transaction is not reversible. \n\n\n### PBFT (Practical Byzantine Fault Tolerance) \n\nTo prevent the above issues, we need other algorithms that guarantee the finality. BFT algorithm is one of those, first published in 1982 by Lamport, Shostak, Pease. In 1999, Miguel Castro and Barbara Liskov introduced \"Practical Byzantine Fault Tolerance\" (PBFT) which provides high-performance state machine replication. \n\nIn the PoW algorithm stated above, though each node receives and validates blocks, there are no message exchanges between nodes to reach a consensus. But in PBFT, each node communicates with other participating nodes to reach a consensus and the finality of the block can be guaranteed as soon as nodes were able to reach a consensus. \n\nThe communication between nodes basically progresses as shown below. But there are some variants which reflect each system’s characteristics. \n\nAs shown above, a participating node in PBFT basically communicates with all nodes in the network in several phases. This characteristic limits the number of nodes because the communication volume increases exponentially as the number of nodes increases. \n\n## Consensus Mechanism in Kaia \n\nKaia is aiming to be an Enterprise-ready and Service-centric platform. Therefore we need to solve the finality problem written above and the network should be able to allow many nodes to participate in the network. To make this possible, Kaia is using an optimized version of Istanbul BFT, which implements PBFT with modifications to deal with blockchain network’s characteristics. \n\nIn Kaia, there are three types of nodes, CN (Consensus Node), PN (Proxy Node) and EN (Endpoint Node). CNs are managed by CCOs (Core Cell Operators) and are in charge of block generation. These blocks are verified by all nodes in the network. Please refer to here to know more about this network topology. \n\n\nKaia achieves fast finality by adopting and improving Istanbul BFT. Because validation and consensus are done for each block there is no fork and the block’s finality is guaranteed instantly as soon as the consensus is made. \n\nAnd also the issue of increasing communication volume in the BFT algorithm is solved by utilizing \n\nrandomly selected (^) Committee. CNs collectively form a (^) Council and on each block generation, part of them are selected as a member of Committee using a VRF (Verifiable Random Function). \n\n\nBecause consensus messages are exchanged only between the committee members, the communication volume can be limited under the designed level even though the total number of CNs increases. \n\nCurrently, Kaia Mainnet can provide a high throughput of 4,000 transactions per second with onesecond block generation interval. More than 50 consensus nodes can participate in the CNN (Consensus Node Network) at the moment and the number will continuously increase as Kaia continues to aggressively optimize the algorithm. \n\nEdit this page Last updated on **Jan 24, 2025** \n\n\nIs this page helpful? \n\n\n",
    " Contract addresses \n\n# Contract addresses \n\nThis page lists the deployed addresses of notable system contracts. You can see the contract code and transactions in the Block Explorers. \n\nSome Kaia features rely on the special smart contracts called system contracts. They hold critical information such as validators and staking. A Kaia node reads the storage states of system contracts as \n\npart of its block processing job. Users and developers can interact with these contracts to query information and build applications such as staking services. \n\n Contract Mainnet \n\n AddressBook 0x0000000000000000000000000000000000000400 0x000000000000 \n\n CypressCredit 0x0000000000000000000000000000000000000000 n/a \n\n KIP-81 GovParam 0x362976Cc2Ef6751DE6bf6008e3E90e1e02deCa51 0x84214cec245d7 \n\n## KIP-103 \n\n TreasuryRebalance \n\n 0xD5ad6D61Dd87EdabE2332607C328f5cc96aeCB95 0xD5ad6D61Dd87 \n\n## KIP-160 \n\n TreasuryRebalanceV2 \n\n 0xa4df15717Da40077C0aD528296AdBBd046579Ee9 0x3D478E73c9dBe \n\n KIP-149 Registry 0x0000000000000000000000000000000000000401 0x000000000000 \n\n## KIP-113 \n\n SimpleBlsRegistry \n\n proxy 0x3e80e75975bdb8e04B800485DD28BebeC6d97679 logic 0xb5ed8d6edd437a0d6ae828580c0aef5678d87f1a \n\n proxy 0x4BEed0651C46 logic 0x6751096fe72d8 \n\nSome contracts are not directly read by Kaia nodes but play crucial roles in operating the Kaia blockchain and its ecosystem.

You need to run an Endpoint Node instead to make your application interact with Kaia network. \n\n## Core Cell Overview \n\nCore Cell (CC) is an entity that is participating in the consensus process, and is in charge of executing transactions and generating blocks. A Kaia Core Cell (CC) consists of the following components. \n\n Consensus Node (CN): Consensus Nodes are participating in the block generation process. Proxy Node (PN): Proxy Nodes provide the interface to the network. PNs transmit the transaction requests to the Consensus Nodes, and propagate the blocks down to the Endpoint Nodes. \n\nIt is recommended that a Core Cell consists of one CN with two or more PNs. A CN connects to other CNs within the Core Cell Network to perform consensus. CNs only accept connections from their PNs in the same Core Cell to receive transaction requests and propagate blocks to the network. PNs accepts connections from any ENs within the Endpoint Node Network. \n\n Make this page better \n\n\n**Name Description Network Security Quantity** \n\n### CN \n\n A node that creates a new block with other CNs in the Core Cell Network \n\n A network is composed of permissioned CNs.

    " Governance Core Governance Changes by KIPs \n\n# Core Governance Changes by \n\n# KIPs \n\nKaia has undergone several hard forks to improve its governance system. These changes reflect the evolving needs of the network and its stakeholders. \n\n## KIP-163: CnStakingV3 With Public Delegation \n\n**Date: 2024-04-30** \n\nKIP-163 introduces a new CnStakingV3 that supports public delegation, allowing general users to delegate and re-delegate their KAIA tokens more easily. The staking information interval is also changed from 86,400 blocks to 1 block to enhance efficiency and accuracy in validator set and reward distribution. The motivation behind this update is to address the limitations of CnStakingV2, where only a few validators offered public delegation services, limiting users' options. By enabling public delegation natively in CnStakingV3, users can delegate their KAIA to any validator offering this service, thus broadening the delegation options and improving network participation. CnStakingV3 will be compatible with existing core contracts like AddressBook and StakingTracker. Public delegation will be facilitated through a new contract named PublicDelegation, based on an interest-bearing token model (ERC4626), where users receive non-transferable shares representing their assets. This approach aims to make the delegation process more transparent and accessible for all users. Additionally, from the FORK_BLOCK onwards, staking information for block N will be derived from block N-1, ensuring more timely and accurate updates in the staking process. This change is designed to support the dynamic nature of staking and delegation in the Kaia network, making it more robust and user-friendly \n\n## KIP-160: An Update On Treasury Fund Rebalancing \n\n**Date: 2024-04-22** \n\nKIP-160 proposes enhancements to the Treasury Fund Rebalancing mechanism, addressing the limitations of KIP-103. The primary motivation is to allow both increases and decreases in fund balances and make the rebalance block number editable. This update involves generalizing the rebalancing process, enabling both the burning and minting of funds, and ensuring the rebalance block number can be aligned with changes in the blockchain’s hard fork schedule. Find the rebalance detail in the contracts addresses page. Make^ this^ page^ better \n\n\n## KIP-149: Unified Deployment and Management of \n\n## System Contracts \n\n**Date: 2023-09-20** \n\nKIP-149 introduces a standardized method for deploying and managing system contracts on the Kaia blockchain. System contracts directly impact or are read by the Kaia core protocol. This proposal includes a centralized Registry Contract to manage these contracts efficiently. Currently, the deployment methods for system contracts lack standardization, leading to inefficiencies. KIP-149 addresses this by introducing key features such as: \n\n Registry Contract: Manages all system contracts, ensuring centralized tracking and governance control through a governance contract. Proxy Pattern: Utilizes the UUPS proxy pattern to separate data storage from logic, allowing updates without affecting stored data and ensuring upgradability. System Contract Lifecycle: Defines stages (Registered, Active, Deprecated) for managing contracts efficiently. Governance and Upgrades: Establishes a community-driven proposal and voting process for new contracts or upgrades, ensuring decentralized control and smooth implementation. KIP-149 aims to enhance Kaia’s governance and operational efficiency by providing a secure, scalable approach to managing system contracts, facilitating smoother upgrades, and promoting decentralized control. \n\n## KIP-103: Treasury Fund Rebalancing \n\n**Date: 2023-04-06** \n\nKIP-103 was introduced with the v1.10.2 release. It introduces a Treasury Fund Rebalancing mechanism which is the proposal for the implementation of KGP-6. \n\nThe KGP-6 proposal aims to establish a sustainable and verifiable KAIA token economy. It was approved by the Governance Council, with 26 out of 31 members voting in favor. The proposal includes contributions from various organizations such as 1inch, Swapscanner, Ground X, and others. The goal is to create a more robust and transparent ecosystem for the KAIA token. Find the rebalance detail in the contracts addresses page. \n\n## KIP-82: KIP-82: A new GC reward structure due to \n\n## abolition of the Gini coefficient \n\n**Date: 2022-09-21** \n\n Make this page better \n\n\nKIP-82, introduced with v1.10.0 and activated at the Kore hardfork, addresses the limitations of Kaia’s previous reward system by removing the Gini coefficient used in block proposer selection and rewards. This change supports the expanding Governance Council, which now includes DAOs alongside traditional enterprises, necessitating a more balanced and inclusive reward system. Key changes include a new reward distribution structure, where 20% of GC rewards go to block proposers and 80% to stakers. This ensures fair compensation for both groups, enhancing network stability and participation. Voting power and rewards are now directly tied to the amount of KAIA tokens staked, encouraging broader network participation and reducing reliance on a few high-stake nodes. Block proposers are selected based on equal opportunity, independent of staking amounts, democratizing the process and enhancing decentralization. To compensate for the opportunity cost of staking, inflationary rewards have been introduced, allowing public users to participate in the staking program managed by the GC and earn rewards, thus promoting network growth and stability. A new governance parameter (reward.kip82ratio) sets the initial reward distribution ratio at 20/80 between proposer and staking rewards, which can be adjusted through governance processes. KIP-82 represents a significant step towards a more equitable and stable governance system in Kaia, ensuring fair compensation for network contributions and fostering a more decentralized and resilient network. \n\n## KIP-81: Implementing the on-chain governance \n\n## voting method \n\n**Date: 2022-09-19** \n\nKIP-81 was introduced with v1.10.0 and activated at the Kore hardfork. It introduced a stake-based voting mechanism through its governance portal. This approach shifts from the current system, where each Governance Council (GC) member casts one vote, to a model where voting power is determined by the amount of staked KAIA, with a cap to prevent any single entity from gaining excessive influence. A GC member will receive one vote per a certain amount of staked KAIA (initially set at 5 million KAIA), with a cap of one less than the total number of GC members. For instance, if there are 35 GC members, the maximum voting power is 34 votes, preventing monopolies. With this system, governance topics are discussed in the Governance Forum and voted on through Klaytn Square, ensuring responsibility and transparency in decision-making. This change aims to make the voting process more transparent and reflect the interests of those most invested in Kaia. By linking voting power to the staking amount, the system incentivizes greater participation and alignment of interests, ensuring that those who contribute more to the ecosystem have a proportionate influence on its decisions. \n\nThis governance structure ensures a fair and balanced decision-making process, aligning voting power with contributions to the ecosystem while preventing any single entity from having undue influence. \n\n Edit this page \n\nLast updated on **Jan 24, 2025** (^) Make this page better \n\n\nIs this page helpful? \n\n Make this page better \n\n\n",

    " Service Chain Quick Start Create nested service chain \n\n# Create nested service chain \n\n### This chapter explains how to build ServiceChain networks in a hierarchical structure by adding a new \n\n### ServiceChain network to the ServiceChain network built in the previous chapter. The ServiceChain \n\n### network to be added also consists of 4 SCNs in this example. The ServiceChain network constructed in \n\n### the previous chapter is defined as L2, and the ServiceChain network to be newly constructed is defined \n\n### as L3. We are going to connect a bridge between L2 and L3 to create a hierarchical structure. The overall \n\n### structure of the ServiceChain network to be constructed in this chapter is shown in the figure below. \n\n## Prerequisites \n\n### Assume that you have progressed to the ServiceChain configuration and Kairos EN described in \n\n### Nested ServiceChain. So we will briefly explain what was explained in the previous section. \n\n### Assumptions and Limitations \n\n### One EN can bridge one-to-one to one of the SCNs of the ServiceChain L2. Similarly, one SCN in \n\n### L2 of the ServiceChain can bridge one-to-one to one of the SCNs in L3. \n\n### An SCN node can have a main bridge and a sub bridge at the same time. However, the port \n\n### numbers of the main bridge and the sub bridge must be set differently. (eg main-bridge: 50505, \n\n### sub-bridge:50506) \n\n\n### Not all SCNs in L2 need to be bridged to EN, and likewise SCNs in L3 need not all be bridged to \n\n### L2. However, for high availability, it is recommended that there are two or more main-bridge and \n\n### sub-bridge pairs between chains. In this chapter, only one pair will be connected between L2 \n\n### and L3, and the high availability between L2 and L3 is same to the HA between Kairos and L2. \n\n## Step 1: Create and update Homi data for L3 \n\n### As when configuring ServiceChain L2, execute the homi command to create scripts and configuration \n\n### files for building L3. You can run homi on any Linux/Mac PC. Kairos’s chainID is 1001 , and L2’s \n\n### chainID was set to^1002 in the previous example, so for convenience, L3’s^ chainID is set to^1003. \n\n### When operating a blockchain for an actual service, you must register a new chainID value at \n\n### https://chainlist.defillama.com/ to avoid the chainID conflict with other ServiceChains and EVM chains. \n\n $ ./homi setup --gen-type local --cn-num 4 --test-num 1 --servicechain --chainID 1003 --p Created : homi-output/keys/passwd1 Created : homi-output/keys/passwd2 Created : homi-output/keys/passwd3 Created : homi-output/keys/passwd4 Created : homi-output/scripts/genesis.json Created : homi-output/keys/nodekey1 Created : homi-output/keys/validator1 Created : homi-output/keys/nodekey2 Created : homi-output/keys/validator2 Created : homi-output/keys/nodekey3 Created : homi-output/keys/validator3 Created : homi-output/keys/nodekey4 Created : homi-output/keys/validator4 Created : homi-output/scripts/static-nodes.json Created : homi-output/keys_test/testkey1 Created : homi-output/keys_test/keystore1/0xdC7218621513f71d609653d22C39d79d558d9CDC Created : homi-output/Kaia.json Created : homi-output/Kaia_txpool.json \n\n\n### Update IP address and port information of ServiceChain L3 nodes in homi\n\n### output/scripts/static-nodes.json. \n\n### Copy homi-output to all SCN nodes (SCN-L3-01, SCN-L3-02, SCN-L3-03, SCN-L3-04) of ServiceChain \n\n### L3. \n\n### Initialize all nodes. \n\n### Connect to all SCNs (SCN-L3-01, SCN-L3-02, SCN-L3-03, and SCN-L3-04), copy static-nodes.json \n\n### to the data folder ~/data , and copy nodekeys one by one. \n\n#### [ \n\n \"kni://358235ccbf97a1f...787f7@192.168.0.21:22323?discport=0&type=cn\", \"kni://14ac4e3d53de5c7...6c91d@192.168.0.22:22323?discport=0&type=cn\", \"kni://5f36a456d93da09...8e216@192.168.0.23:22323?discport=0&type=cn\", \"kni://d62fd0928b9b6e5...6badf@192.168.0.24:22323?discport=0&type=cn\" ] \n\n $ scp -r path/to/homi-output user@192.168.0.21:~/ $ scp -r path/to/homi-output user@192.168.0.22:~/ $ scp -r path/to/homi-output user@192.168.0.23:~/ $ scp -r path/to/homi-output user@192.168.0.24:~/ \n\n $ kscn --datadir ~/data init ~/homi-output/scripts/genesis.json $ ls ~/data keystore klay kscn \n\n $ cp ~/homi-output/scripts/static-nodes.json ~/data/ $ cp ~/homi-output/keys/nodekey{1..4} ~/data/klay/nodekey \n\n Make this page better \n\n\n## Step 2: SCN configuration in L3 \n\n### Edit conf/kscnd.conf on all SCNs in ServiceChain L3 as follows: The PORT uses 22323, the default \n\nport of the ServiceChain.

In other words, you can debug a confirmed transaction after the fact, making it a \n\n#### useful tool for dApp development. \n\n#### There are various methods where you can retrieve debug traces \n\n#### Call debug namespace JSON-RPC APIs on-demand. \n\n#### Receive into kafka via chaindatafetcher on-demand. \n\n#### Receive into kafka via chaindatafetcher from a node as the node syncs blocks. \n\n#### Use block explorers or indexer services, which is outside scope of this document. \n\n## Using debug APIs \n\nThe go-to method is to calling the (^) debug_trace* JSON-RPC APIs. \n\n## Tracer types \n\n#### To get traces with the debug API, you first need to decide what kind of information you want to learn. \n\n#### Most commonly, you’ll want to use callTracer^ to understand the interaction between contracts i.e. \n\n#### internal transactions. There are other tracer types like prestateTracer and structLogger that allow \n\n#### you to debug the same transaction from multiple angles. Below lists some frequently used tracers. \n\n#### NOTE : Since Kaia v1.0.1 callTracer and fastCallTracer are identical as they consolidated to one \n\n#### native (Go) implementation. \n\n**NOTE** : Since Kaia v1.0.1 (^) callTracer and (^) fastCallTracer outputs are updated to more correctly \n\n#### reflect the execution. The same transaction could have yielded different trace in previous versions. See \n\n#### the GitHub PR for the details. \n\n#### Predefined tracers \n\n#### callTracer traces contract calls and contract creation within a transaction (internal tx). \n\n#### Returns the specific call or create opcode, revert reason, and gas spending at each call frame. \n\n#### Its use has been discouraged for slow speed, but since v1.0.1 the problem was resolved. \n\nDevelopers can safely use this tracer. (^) Make this page better \n\n\n#### fastCallTracer is a Golang implementation of^ callTracer. But since v1.0.1 the two are \n\n#### identical, so there is no need to use fastCallTracer anymore. \n\n#### prestateTracer returns information needed to construct a custom local genesis state that \n\n#### this transaction can run on. Useful for creating a test case out of live blockchain data. \n\n#### revertTracer returns the revert reason, if any. This can be replaced by callTracer which \n\n#### returns .reverted.reason and .revertReason fields. \n\n#### Refer to API reference for the full list of supported tracers. \n\n#### structLogger is the tracer activated when you don’t specify any tracer. The execution of every \n\n#### opcode is shown in detail which is extremely heavy and usually too verbose for application \n\n#### debugging. \n\n#### Custom JS tracer is also supported, unless the node prohibits its use with --rpc.unsafe\n\n#### debug.disable option. You can submit a piece of JavaScript code that gets invoked alongside \n\n#### transaction execution. Below is an example custom tracer that prints the gasUsed after each \n\nopcode (^) \"{gasUsed: [], step: function(log) { this.gasUsed.push(log.getGas()); }, \n\n#### result: function() { return this.gasUsed; }, fault: function() {}}\". You can find \n\n#### more about custom JS tracer here and here. \n\n### CallTracer special cases \n\n#### Kaia’s callTracer output format is identical to go-ethereum except for following: \n\n#### For revered transactions, both fields are provided. \n\n#### result.revertReason : revert reason string, if any. \n\n#### result.reverted.contract : the address of the reverted contract. \n\n#### result.reverted.message : same as revertReason \n\n > debug.traceTransaction(\"0x49aa6074a3b4970399ef2af12b109c4cb4a65ab8a833d1540e4cefa657a3c { error: \"execution reverted\", from: \"0x7f0546832758f61410e81a94d7a07d55b1dfd278\", gas: \"0xc350\", gasUsed: \"0x6992\", input: \"0x96670644\", output: \"0x08c379a000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000200000 revertReason: \"bad input\", reverted: { contract: \"0xe6c5b1cbf283d9482088136b8cee53fdb6c088eb\", message: \"bad input\" }, to: \"0xe6c5b1cbf283d9482088136b8cee53fdb6c088eb\", type: \"CALL\", value: \"0x0\" } \n\n\n#### Some transaction types that does not execute VM are treated as 0 KAIA transfer to the sender \n\n#### itself. Those transaction types are AccountUpdate, Cancel, ChainDataAnchoring and their fee \n\n#### delegated variants. \n\n### Batch tracing \n\n#### Debug tracers can be retrieved at different granularity. \n\n#### debug_traceTransaction traces a single transaction hash \n\ndebug_traceBlockByNumber (^) and debug_traceBlockByHash (^) traces all transactions in a block \n\n#### debug_traceBlobkByRange traces consecutive blocks in a range \n\n#### debug_traceCall lets you run an^ eth_call at the given block’s final state. This is useful for \n\n#### simulating a transaction execution before sending it. \n\n### State regeneration \n\n#### When an full-mode node serves the debug trace APIs it may undergo historical state regeneration. \n\n#### Suppose you requested to trace a block. The node has to execute the block from the parent block’s final \n\n#### state. But a full-mode node stores block states only so often (every other 128 blocks by default), so the \n\n#### node re-exectues blocks from the nearest saved state. At worst case tracing one block takes executing \n\n#### 127 blocks. Therefore a full-mode node may respond to debug trace APIs slowly. If you are going to \n\n#### requeat a large number, you must use an archive-mode nodes. \n\n## Using chaindatafetcher \n\n#### Chaindatafetcher (CDF) is a unique feature of Kaia where block processing results are published into \n\n#### Kafka queue to simplify building downstream data services. For instance a block explorer can utilize CDF \n\n#### to populate its database. \n\n > kaia.getTransaction(\"0xac43859eb4064916e8be8e74645d6019cc48cb6791f68ea21d42ead6bba569b5 \"TxTypeAccountUpdate\" > debug.traceTransaction(\"0xac43859eb4064916e8be8e74645d6019cc48cb6791f68ea21d42ead6bba56 { from: \"0x7f0546832758f61410e81a94d7a07d55b1dfd278\", gas: \"0xcd14\", gasUsed: \"0xa028\", input: \"0x\", to: \"0x7f0546832758f61410e81a94d7a07d55b1dfd278\", type: \"CALL\", value: \"0x0\" } \n\n\n#### NOTE : Since Kaia v1.0.1 tracegroup (internally callTracer) outputs are updated to more correctly reflect \n\n#### the execution. The same transaction could have yielded different trace in previous versions. See the \n\n#### GitHub PR for the details. \n\n### Connecting to Kafka \n\n#### Prepare a Kafka cluster first. You can test chaindatafetcher with below example docker compose \n\n#### configuration, but you can use any Kafka installation. \n\n#### Then direct the node to connect to Kafka. Below is a minimal CDF configuration in your kend.conf , \n\nThe node publishes to two Kafka topics. (^) blockgroup carries block header, consensus-related information, and transaction receipts. (^) tracegroup , when enabled, carries internal tx traces (i.e. \n\n#### callTrace) of the block. Below are the default topic names. \n\nThe (^) ken command line flags (^) --chaindatafetcher.* let you customize topic names, partitions, \n\n#### replicas and other Kafka configurations. \n\n### Traces from currently syncing block \n\n # Test kafka docker-compose.yml.

    " Smart Contracts Deploy Smart Contracts Deploy smart contract using Foundry \n\n# Deploy smart contract using \n\n# Foundry \n\n## Introduction \n\n#### Foundry is a smart contract development framework written in Rust that enables developers to manage \n\n#### and compile contracts, run tests, deploy contracts, and interact with the network from the command \n\n#### line via solidity scripts. \n\n#### Foundry consists of four main CLI tools that allow for fast and modular smart contract development, \n\n#### namely: \n\n#### Forge: You can deploy, test, and compile smart contracts using Forge. \n\n#### Cast: Cast has made it simple to interact with EVM smart contracts. This includes obtaining chain \n\n#### data, sending transactions, and other things. \n\n#### Anvil: Do you need to spin up a local node? Anvil is a local node environment offered by Foundry. \n\n#### Chisel: Fast, useful, and verbose solidity REPL. \n\n#### In this guide, you will: \n\n#### Create a simple foundry project. \n\n#### Compile and test a sample smart contract using Foundry. \n\n#### Deploy smart contracts using Foundry to the Kaia Kairos Network. \n\n#### Explore forking mainnet with cast and anvil. \n\n Make this page better \n\n\n## Pre-requisites \n\n#### To follow this tutorial, the following are the prerequisites: \n\n#### Code editor: a source-code editor such VS Code. \n\n#### MetaMask: used to deploy the contracts, sign transactions and interact with the contracts. \n\n#### RPC Endpoint: you can get this from one of the supported endpoint providers. \n\n#### Test KAIA from Faucet: fund your account with sufficient KAIA. \n\n#### Install Rust and Foundry. \n\n## Setting Up Your Development Environment \n\n#### To check if your foundry installation was successful, run the command below: \n\n#### Output \n\n#### After successfully installing foundry, you now have access to the CLI tools (forge, cast, anvil, chisel) \n\n#### available in foundry. Let’s set up a foundry project in the following steps: \n\n#### Step 1 : To start a new project, run the command below: \n\n#### Step 2 : Navigate into your project folder. \n\n#### After initializing a foundry project, your current directory should include: \n\n#### src : the default directory for your smart contracts. \n\n#### tests : the default directory for tests. \n\n#### foundry.toml : the default project configuration file. \n\n#### lib : the default directory for project dependencies. \n\n#### script : the default directory for solidity scripting files. \n\n forge -V \n\n forge init foundry_example \n\n cd foundry_example ls \n\n Make^ this^ page^ better \n\n\n## Sample smart contract \n\n#### In this section, we will be using the sample counter contract in the initialized foundry project. The \n\n#### counter.sol file in the src/ folder should look like this: \n\n#### Code Walkthrough \n\n#### This is your smart contract. Line 1 shows it uses the Solidity version 0.8.13 or greater. From lines 4-12 , a \n\nsmart contract (^) Counter is created. This contract simply stores a new number using the **setNumber** \n\n#### function and increments it by calling the increment function. \n\n## Testing smart contract \n\n#### Foundry allows us to write tests in solidity as opposed to writing tests in javascript in other smart \n\ncontract development frameworks. In our initialized foundry project, the (^) test/Counter.t.sol is an \n\n#### example of a test written in solidity. The code looks like this: \n\n // SPDX-License-Identifier: UNLICENSED pragma solidity ^0.8.13; contract Counter { uint256 public number; function setNumber( uint256 newNumber ) public { number = newNumber; } function increment() public { number++; } } \n\n // SPDX-License-Identifier: UNLICENSED pragma solidity ^0.8.13; import \"forge-std/Test.sol\"; import \"../src/Counter.sol\"; contract CounterTest is Test { Counter public counter; function setUp() public { counter = new Counter(); counter.setNumber( 0 ); } function testIncrement() public { counter.increment(); assertEq(counter.number(), 1 ); } function testSetNumber( uint256 x ) public { counter.setNumber(x); assertEq(counter.number(), x); } }^ Make^ this^ page^ better \n\n\n#### The code above shows you imported forge standard library and Counter.sol. \n\n#### The tests above check the following: \n\n#### Is the number increasing? \n\n#### Is the number equal to the set number? \n\n#### To check if your test works fine, run the following command: \n\n#### Output \n\n#### To learn more about writing tests, advanced testing, and other features, refer to Foundry’s \n\n#### documentation. \n\n## Compiling your contracts \n\n#### Compile your contract with this command: \n\n## Deploying your contracts \n\n#### To deploy a contract using foundry, you must provide an RPC URL and a private key of the account that \n\n#### will deploy the contract. Take a look at the list of rpc-providers on Kaia to find your rpc-url, and create an \n\n#### account using MetaMask. \n\n#### Step 1 : To deploy your contract to the Kaia Kairos network, run the command below: \n\n forge test \n\n forge build \n\n $ forge create --rpc-url <your_rpc_url> --private-key <your_private_key Make> src/Counter.sol: this page better \n\n\n#### Example \n\n#### WARNING: Replace the private key argument with your private key from MetaMask. Be very careful \n\n#### not to expose your private key. \n\n#### Output \n\n#### Step 2 : Open Kaiascope to check if the counter contract deployed successfully. \n\n#### Step 3 : Copy and paste the transaction hash in the search field and press Enter. You should see the \n\n#### recently deployed contract. \n\n## Interacting with the contract \n\n#### After successfully deploying your smart contract, you will want to call and execute functions right. Let’s \n\n#### get to interact with the deployed contracts on Kaia Kairos Network using Cast. In this section, you will \n\n#### learn how to use the cast call to execute the read-only function and cast send to execute write \n\n#### functions. \n\n forge create --rpc-url https://public-en-kairos.node.kaia.io --private-key hhdhdhdhprivat \n\n(^) Make this page better \n\n\n**A. cast call** : To get the number stored in the contract, you will be calling the (^) number function.

    " Get Started Deploy your first smart contract using Hardhat \n\n# Deploy your first smart contract \n\n# using Hardhat \n\n## Introduction \n\n#### This section will guide you through deploying a Soulbound Token to the Kaia Kairos Network using \n\n#### Hardhat. \n\n#### Hardhat is a smart-contract development environment that will help you: \n\n#### Develop and compile smart contracts. \n\n#### Debug, test, and deploy smart contracts and dApps. \n\n#### Soul-bound tokens(SBTs) are non-transferable NFTs. Meaning once acquired, they cannot be sold or \n\n#### transferred to another user. To learn more about SBTs, how it works and their use case, you can check \n\n#### out this reference article published by Vitalik Buterin. \n\n#### By the end of this guide you will be able to: \n\n#### Set up a Hardhat project on Kaia. \n\n#### Create a simple soul-bound token. \n\n#### Compile your smart contract using Hardhat. \n\n#### Test, deploy, and interact with your smart contract using Hardhat. \n\n#### Explore Hardhat forking feature. \n\n## Pre-requisites \n\n Make this page better \n\n\n#### To follow this tutorial, the following are the prerequisites: \n\n#### Code editor: a source-code editor such VS Code. \n\n#### Metamask: used to deploy the contracts, sign transactions and interact with the contracts. \n\n#### RPC Endpoint: you can get this from one of the supported Endpoint Providers. \n\n#### Test KAIA from Faucet: fund your account with sufficient KAIA. \n\n#### NodeJS and NPM \n\n## Setting Up Your Development Environment \n\n#### To make use of hardhat, we need to set up our development environment and get hardhat installed. Let’s \n\n#### do this in the following steps: \n\n#### Step 1 : Create a project directory \n\n#### Step 2 : Initialize an npm project \n\n#### Paste this command in your terminal to create a package.json file \n\n#### Step 3 : Install hardhat and other dependencies: \n\n#### Paste the code below in your terminal to install hardhat \n\n#### Paste the code below to install other dependencies \n\nNote: This installs other dependencies needed for this project ranging from (^) hardhat , \n\n#### klaytn/contract , dotenv et al. \n\n#### Step 4 : Initialise a hardhat project: \n\n#### Run the command below to initiate an hardhat project \n\n mkdir soulbound-tokens cd soulbound-tokens \n\n npm init -y \n\n npm install --save-dev hardhat \n\n npm install dotenv @kaiachain/contracts \n\n Make this page better \n\n\n#### For this guide, you’ll be selecting a typescript project as seen below: \n\n#### Note: While initializing the project, you will get a prompt to install hardhat-toolbox plugin. The \n\n#### plugin bundles all the commonly used packages and Hardhat plugins recommended to start \n\n#### developing with Hardhat. \n\n#### After initializing a hardhat project, your current directory should include: \n\n#### contracts/ – this folder contains smart contract code. \n\n npx hardhat \n\n(^) Make this page better \n\n\n#### ignition/modules/ – this folder contains code that deploys your contracts on the blockchain network. \n\n#### test/ – this folder contains all unit tests that test your smart contract. \n\n#### hardhat.config.js – this file contains configurations important for the work of Hardhat and the \n\n#### deployment of the soul-bound token. \n\n#### Step 5 : Create a .env file \n\n#### Now create your .env file in the project folder. This file helps us load environment variables from an .env \n\n#### file into process.env. \n\n#### Paste this command in your terminal to create a .env file \n\n#### After creating our file, let’s configure our .env file to look like this: \n\n#### Note: You can also choose to use the configuration variable functionality provided by hardhat to \n\n#### configure variables that shouldn’t be included in the code repository. \n\n#### Step 6 : Setup Hardhat Configs \n\n#### Modify your hardhat.config.js with the following configurations: \n\n#### Now that we have our development environment all set, let’s get into writing our soul-bound token smart \n\n#### contract. \n\n touch .env \n\n KAIROS_TESTNET_URL= \"Your Kairos RPC link\" PRIVATE_KEY= \"your private key copied from MetaMask wallet\" \n\n require(\"@nomicfoundation/hardhat-toolbox\"); require('dotenv').config() \n\n module. exports = { solidity: \"0.8.17\", networks: { kairos: { url: process.env.KAIROS_TESTNET_URL || \"\", gasPrice: 250000000000 , accounts: process.env.PRIVATE_KEY !== undefined? [process.env.PRIVATE_KEY] : [], } } }; \n\n Make^ this^ page^ better \n\n\n## Creating SBT Smart Contract \n\n#### In this section, you will use the Kaia Contracts: a library for secure smart contract development built on a \n\n#### solid foundation of community-vetted code. It is a fork of open zeppelin contracts. \n\n#### Note: You already installed this library in step 3 of the Setting Development Environment \n\n#### section. \n\n#### Step 1 : Select the contracts folder in the Explorer pane, click the New File button and create a new file \n\n#### named SBT.sol \n\n#### Step 2 : Open the file and paste the following code: \n\n#### Code Walkthrough \n\n#### This is your smart contract. line 1 shows that Hardhat uses the Solidity version 0.8.7 or greater. Other \n\n#### than that, it imports KIP17.sol and other supporting contracts. From lines 6-12 , a smart contract that \n\n#### inherits KIP17 is been created. Also, the token name and symbol was passed in the constructor. \n\n // SPDX-License-Identifier: MIT pragma solidity ^0.8. 7 ; \n\n import \"@kaiachain/contracts/KIP/token/KIP17/KIP17.sol\"; import \"@kaiachain/contracts/utils/Counters.sol\"; import \"@kaiachain/contracts/access/Ownable.sol\"; \n\n contract SoulBoundToken is KIP17, Ownable { using Counters for Counters.Counter; \n\n Counters.Counter private _tokenIdCounter; \n\n constructor() KIP17(\"SoulBoundToken\", \"SBT\") {} \n\n function safeMint( address to ) public onlyOwner { uint256 tokenId = _tokenIdCounter.current(); _tokenIdCounter.increment(); _safeMint(to, tokenId); } \n\n function _beforeTokenTransfer( address from , address to , uint256 ) pure override intern require(from == address( 0 ) || to == address( 0 ), \"This a Soulbound token. It canno } \n\n function _burn( uint256 tokenId ) internal override( KIP17 ) { super ._burn(tokenId); } } \n\n Make this page better \n\n\n#### As you can see in the code above, the token name and symbol have been set to SoulBoundToken and \n\n#### SBT respectively. You can change the token name and symbol to anything you desire. \n\n#### One major thing in this contract is that it prohibits token transfer, which makes the issued tokens \n\n#### soulbond. \n\n## Testing SBT Smart Contract \n\n#### In this section, we would be testing some of our contract functionalities. \n\n#### Step 1 : In the Explorer pane, select the test folder and click the New File button to create a new file \n\n#### named sbtTest.js \n\n#### Step 2 : Copy the code below in the sbtTest.js file. \n\n // This is an example test file. Hardhat will run every *.js file in test/, // so feel free to add new ones. \n\n // Hardhat tests are normally written with Mocha and Chai. \n\n // We import Chai to use its asserting functions here. const { expect } = require(\"chai\"); \n\n // We use loadFixture to share common setups (or fixtures) between tests. // Using this simplifies your tests and makes them run faster, by taking // advantage of Hardhat Network's snapshot functionality. const { loadFixture } = require(\"@nomicfoundation/hardhat-network-helpers\"); \n\n // describe is a Mocha function that allows you to organize your tests. // Having your tests organized makes debugging them easier. All Mocha // functions are available in the global scope. // // describe receives the name of a section of your test suite, and a // callback. The callback must define the tests of that section. This callback // can't be an async function. describe(\"Token contract\", function () { // We define a fixture to reuse the same setup in every test. We use // loadFixture to run this setup once, snapshot that state, and reset Hardhat // Network to that snapshot in every test. async function deployTokenFixture() { // Get the ContractFactory and Signers here. const [owner, addr1, addr2] = await ethers.getSigners(); \n\n // To deploy our contract, we just have to call ethers.deployContract() and call the // waitForDeployment() method, which happens onces its transaction has been // mined. \n\n const sbtContract = await ethers.deployContract(\"SoulBoundToken\"); \n\n await sbtContract.waitForDeployment(); \n\n // Fixtures can return anything you consider useful for your tests \n\n Make this page better \n\n\n#### In the code you just copied, line 7 & 12 shows you imported expect from Chai and loadFixture from \n\n#### hardhat-network-helpers. \n\n#### The tests above check the following: \n\n#### Is the owner of a particular token id the same as who it was minted to? \n\n#### Did it prohibit transfer of tokens between accounts? \n\n return { sbtContract, owner, addr1, addr2 }; } \n\n // You can nest describe calls to create subsections. describe(\"Deployment\", function () { // it is another Mocha function. This is the one you use to define each // of your tests. It receives the test name, and a callback function. // // If the callback function is async, Mocha will await it. it(\"Should mint SBT to owner\", async function () { const { sbtContract, owner } = await loadFixture(deployTokenFixture); const safemint = await sbtContract.safeMint(owner.address); expect(await sbtContract.ownerOf( 0 )).to.equal(owner.address); }); }); \n\n describe(\"Transactions\", function () { it(\"Should prohibit token transfer using transferFrom\", async function () { const { sbtContract, owner, addr1 } = await loadFixture( deployTokenFixture ); \n\n const safemintTx = await sbtContract.safeMint(owner.address); \n\n // prohibit token transfer of token id (0) from owner to addr1 await expect( sbtContract.transferFrom(owner.address, addr1.address, 0 ) ).to.be.reverted; }); \n\n it(\"Should prohibit token transfer using safeTransferFrom\", async function () { const { sbtContract, owner, addr1 } = await loadFixture( deployTokenFixture ); \n\n const safemintTx = await sbtContract.safeMint(owner.address); \n\n // prohibit token transfer of token id (0) from owner to addr1 await expect(sbtContract['safeTransferFrom(address,address,uint256)']( owner.address, addr1.address, 0 )).to.be.reverted; }); }); }) \n\n Make this page better \n\n\n#### Step 3 : To run your test, run the command below: \n\n#### For more in-depth guide on testing, please check Hardhat testing. \n\n## Deploying the smart contract \n\n#### Scripts are JavaScript/Typescript files that help you deploy contracts to the blockchain network. In this \n\n#### section, you will create a script for the smart contract. \n\n#### Step 1 : In the Explorer pane, select the \"scripts\" folder and click the New File button to create a new file \n\n#### named sbtDeploy.js. \n\n#### Step 2 : Copy and paste the following code inside the file. \n\n#### Note: input your MetaMask wallet address in the deployerAddr variable. \n\n npx hardhat test test/sbtTest.js \n\n const { ethers } = require(\"hardhat\"); Make this page better \n\n\n#### Step 3 : In the terminal, run the following command which tells Hardhat to deploy your SBT token on the \n\n#### Kaia Test Network (Kairos) \n\n async function main() { \n\n const deployerAddr = \"Your Metamask wallet address\"; const deployer = await ethers.getSigner(deployerAddr); \n\n console.log(Deploying contracts with the account: ${deployer.address}); console.log(Account balance: ${(await deployer.provider.getBalance(deployerAddr)).toSt \n\n const sbtContract = await ethers.deployContract(\"SoulBoundToken\"); await sbtContract.waitForDeployment(); \n\n console.log(Congratulations! You have just successfully deployed your soul bound tokens. console.log(SBT contract address is ${sbtContract.target}. You can verify on https://kai } \n\n // We recommend this pattern to be able to use async/await everywhere // and properly handle errors. main().catch(( error ) => { console.error(error); process.exitCode = 1 ; }); \n\n npx hardhat run ignition/modules/sbtDeploy.js --network kairos \n\n Make this page better \n\n\n#### Step 4 : Open Kaiascope to check if the SBT token has been deployed successfully. \n\n#### Step 5 : Copy and paste the deployed contract address in the search field and press Enter. You should \n\n#### see the recently deployed contract. \n\n Make this page better \n\n\n## Hardhat Forking \n\n#### Hardhat provides developers the functionality of simulating the mainnet (at any given block) to a local \n\n#### development network. One of the major benefit of this feature is that it enables developers to interact \n\n#### with deployed contract and also write test for complex cases. \n\n#### For this feature to work effectively, you need to connect to an archive node. You can read more about \n\n#### this feature here \n\n### Forking Mainnet \n\n#### Now that we have our Hardhat project set up let’s fork the Kaia Mainnet using Hardhat. Open your \n\n#### terminal and run this command \n\n#### You can also configure hardhat.config.js^ Hardhat Network to always do this: \n\n npx hardhat node --fork <YOUR ARCHIVE NODE URL> \n\n npx hardhat node --fork https://archive-en.node.kaia.io \n\n networks: { hardhat: { \n\n Make this page better \n\n\n#### Output \n\n#### After successfully running this command, your terminal looks like the above image. You'll have 20 \n\n#### development accounts that are pre-funded with 10,000 test tokens. \n\n#### The forked chain’s RPC server is listening at http://127.0.0.1:8545/. You can verify the forked \n\n#### network by querying the latest block number. Let’s try to make a cURL to the RPC to get the block \n\n#### number. Open a new terminal window and use the following command: \n\n#### Output \n\n forking: { url: \"<YOUR ARCHIVE NODE URL>\", } } } \n\n curl --data '{\"method\":\"eth_blockNumber\",\"params\":[],\"id\":1,\"jsonrpc\":\"2.0\"}' -H \"Content \n\n Make this page better \n\n\n#### The output is an hexadecimal as seen above. To get the block number from the hex, convert the hex to a \n\n#### decimal using this tool. You should get the latest block number from the time you forked the network. \n\n#### You can confirm the block number on kaiascope. \n\n### Forking at a Block \n\n#### With hardhat, you can fork the mainnet at a particular block. In that case, let’s fork the chain at block \n\n#### number 105701850. \n\n#### To confirm the forked chain at the stated block, open a new terminal window and use the following \n\n#### command: \n\n npx hardhat node --fork <YOUR ARCHIVE NODE URL> --fork-block-number 105701850 \n\n npx hardhat node --fork https://archive-en.node.kaia.io --fork-block-number 105701850 \n\n curl --data '{\"method\":\"eth_blockNumber\",\"params\":[],\"id\":1,\"jsonrpc\":\"2.0\"}' -H \"Content \n\n Make this page better \n\n\n#### The output returns hexadecimal which when converted using this tool should be equal to 105701850. \n\n#### For more in-depth guide on Hardhat, please refer to Hardhat Docs.

    " Smart Contracts Deploy Smart Contracts Deploying smart contract using Thirdweb \n\n# Deploying smart contract using \n\n# Thirdweb \n\n## Introduction \n\nThis section will guide you through deploying a Marketplace contract and a corresponding NFT collection contract to Kaia Network using ThirdWeb. Thirdweb is a complete web3 development framework that provides everything you need to connect your apps and games to decentralized networks. \n\nMarketplace contract allows users to list NFTs for direct sale or auction, thus enhancing the buying and selling of NFTs, just like it’s done on OpenSea. \n\nBy the end of this guide, you will be able to: \n\n create and customize contracts using thirdweb. compile, deploy, and interact with your smart contract using thirdweb. \n\n## Getting Started \n\nIn this article, we will explore the different means to create, customize, and deploy contracts using thirdweb, viz. \n\n Using the thirdweb dashboard Using the thirdweb CLI \n\n\nFor this guide, we will be demonstrating how to deploy a MarketPlace contract using the thirdweb dashboard and also deploying a corresponding nft collection to be listed on the marketplace using the thirdweb CLI. \n\n Note: We will not be explaining the mechanics of the marketplace contract as our focus is to explore thirdweb dashboard and CLI for creating, deploying, and interacting with smart contracts. \n\n## Creating and deploying marketplace contract using \n\n## thirdweb dashboard \n\nIn this section, we will create and deploy a marketplace contract using thirdweb dashboard. To do this, follow the steps below: \n\n1. Head over to thirdweb dashboard and select the **MarketPlace** contract from the list of contracts. \n\n2. Click **Deploy Now** in the contract overview dashboard. \n\n3. Configure the marketplace contract to include the following parameters: the **name** of the     marketplace, its **description** , and **image**. \n\n\n4. Click **Deploy Now** as seen in the image above and wait for the transaction to complete. \n\nOnce the transaction has been successfully executed, you can verify your deployment by pasting the contract address in the search bar of Kaiascope. \n\n## Creating and deploying an NFT collection contract \n\n## using thirdweb CLI \n\nIn this section, we will create and deploy the NFT collection to be listed in our Marketplace using thirdweb CLI. To do this, follow the steps below: \n\n### Creating the contract \n\n1. Run this command in your terminal to create your contract: \n\n2. Enter your preferred values for the command-line prompts: \n\n npx thirdweb create --contract \n\n\n i. Give your project a name. \n\n ii. Choose your preferred framework: Hardhat or Foundry. \n\n iii. Name your smart contract. \n\n iv. Choose the type of base contract: Empty , ERC20 , ERC721 , or ERC1155. Add any desired extensions. For this tutorial, we will select ERC721 and setting the extension to none. \n\n3. Once created, navigate to your project’s root directory and open your project in your preferred code     editor. \n\n4. If you open the contracts folder, your contract should look like this: \n\n // SPDX-License-Identifier: MIT pragma solidity ^0.8. 0 ; import \"@thirdweb-dev/contracts/base/ERC721Base.sol\"; contract nftcollection is ERC721Base { constructor( address _defaultAdmin, string memory _name, string memory _symbol, address _royaltyRecipient, uint128 _royaltyBps ) ERC721Base( _defaultAdmin, _name, _symbol, _royaltyRecipient, _royaltyBps ) {}^ Make^ this^ page^ better \n\n\nThe contract above demonstrates basic ERC721Base functionality. It imports and inherits the **ERC721Base** contract, and it also implements the required methods, including the constructor and its dependent parameters. \n\nYou can modify the contract to your desired custom logic, and once done, your contract is ready for deployment. \n\n### Deploying the contract \n\n1. Navigate to your project root folder and run the command in your terminal: \n\nExecuting this command will trigger the following actions: \n\n detects the framework (hardhat, foundry) compiles all the contracts in the current directory. allows you to select which contract(s) you wish to deploy. upload your compiled smart contract code (in the form of an Application Binary Interface, or ABI) to IPFS. \n\n2. When deployment is complete, a dashboard interface will open to fill out the remaining parameters. \n\n _name : contract name _symbol : symbol or \"ticker\" _royaltyRecipient : wallet address to receive royalties from secondary sales _royaltyBps : basis points (bps) that will be given to the royalty recipient for each secondary sale, e.g., 500 = 5% \n\n3. Select Kaia Mainnet as the network to deploy the contract to. \n\n } \n\n npx thirdweb deploy \n\n\n4. Once your smart contract is deployed, you can manage additional settings and functionalities     through its dashboard. For example, you can upload NFTs, configure permissions and access     control, and add new features. \n\nYou can learn more about thirdweb deploy command in this deploy guide. \n\n## Interacting with deployed contracts \n\nIn this section, we will mint an NFT and also transferring it to another account using the **mint** and **transferfrom** function respectively. Let’s go over it in the following steps: \n\n### Minting the NFT \n\n1. Navigate to the newly deployed contract ( **puppyKlan-NC** ) dashboard. \n\n2. Click on the **mint** function in the **NFTs** tab under the contract dashboard. \n\n3. Fill in the parameters needed for minting the NFT: **name** , **media** , **description** , and **properties**. \n\n\n4. Verify your input and click the **Mint NFT** button. \n\n5. Confirm the transaction and wait for it to complete. Once done, you should see your NFT added to     the dashboard, like below: \n\n### Transferring the NFT to a new owner \n\n1. Head to the Explorer tab in the contract ( **puppyKlan-NC** ) dashboard. \n\n2. Select the **transferFrom** function under the Write tab, as shown below. \n\n3. Fill in the necessary function arguments: from (address), to (address), and id (uint256). \n\n\n4. Confirm the transaction and wait for it to complete. \n\n## Conclusion \n\nCongratulations! if you made it to the end of this guide.

\n\n#### balanceOf is a mandatory method of ERC-20. balanceOf returns the balance of the given address. \n\n#### balanceOf just returns of value of key^ account stored in^ _balances which is^ mapping (address => \n\n#### uint256) type as below. \n\n#### If there is no key account available in _balances , then it just returns 0. \n\n**(2)** (^) **function transfer(address recipient, uint256 amount) external returns (bool);** \n\n#### transfer is a mandatory method of ERC-20.^ transfer transfers^ amount of tokens to^ recipient , \n\n#### and MUST fire the Transfer event. The function SHOULD throw if the message caller’s account balance \n\n#### does not have enough tokens to spend. \n\n#### transfer just invokes internal method^ _transfer which implements actual transfer and event as \n\n#### below. \n\n#### _transfer implements actual behavior of transfer method of ERC-20. \n\nIn addition, it prevents sending token from or to zero address using (^) require as below. function balanceOf(address account) public view returns (uint256) { return _balances[account]; } mapping (address => uint256) private _balances; function transfer(address recipient, uint256 amount) public returns (bool) { _transfer(msg.sender, recipient, amount); return true; } function _transfer(address sender, address recipient, uint256 amount) internal { require(sender != address(0), \"ERC20: transfer from the zero address\"); require(recipient != address(0), \"ERC20: transfer to the zero address\"); _balances[sender] = _balances[sender].sub(amount); Make this page better \n\n\n#### (3) function approve(address spender, uint256 amount) external returns (bool); \n\n#### approve is a mandatory method of ERC-20. approve allows spender to withdraw from your account \n\n#### multiple times, up to the amount^. If this function is called multiple times, it simply resets the allowance \n\n#### to amount. \n\n#### approve just invokes internal method^ _approve which implements actual behavior of^ approve. \n\n#### msg.sender is passed as the account owner. \n\n#### _approve updates _allowances which is a 2-dimensional dictionary maintaining allowed value for \n\n#### spender from specific^ address. \n\n#### (4) function _mint(address account, uint256 amount) internal \n\n_mint (^) is not part of ERC-20. However we need a way to create new ERC-20 tokens and introduced \n\n#### _mint to create new tokens in this implementation as below. \n\n#### _mint is an internal method and can be invoked inside of this contract. \n\n _balances[recipient] = _balances[recipient].add(amount); emit Transfer(sender, recipient, amount); } \n\n function approve(address spender, uint256 value) public returns (bool) { _approve(msg.sender, spender, value); return true; } \n\n function _approve(address owner, address spender, uint256 value) internal { require(owner != address(0), \"ERC20: approve from the zero address\"); require(spender != address(0), \"ERC20: approve to the zero address\"); \n\n _allowances[owner][spender] = value; emit Approval(owner, spender, value); } \n\n mapping (address => mapping (address => uint256)) private _allowances; \n\n function _mint(address account, uint256 amount) internal { require(account != address(0), \"ERC20: mint to the zero address\"); \n\n _totalSupply = _totalSupply.add(amount); _balances[account] = _balances[account].add(amount); emit Transfer(address(0), account, amount); } \n\n Make this page better \n\n\nIn (^) MyERC20.sol , (^) _mint is invoked only once from (^) constructor when deploying the smart contract to \n\n#### mint a predefined amount of token. \n\n#### If you want to issue additional tokens after deploying the smart contract, you have to introduce a new \n\npublic method such as (^) mint. The method should be implemented with CAUTION because only \n\n#### authorized users should be able to mint tokens. \n\n#### Please take a look at OpenZeppelin example ERC20Mintable.sol for more detail. \n\n## 2.

For example, MyERC20. \n\n#### Assign the following arguments at deployment KAIROSTOKEN , KAIROS and 8 \n\n#### Click Deploy. \n\n Make this page better \n\n\n#### After deploying, you can invoke balanceOf with your account, which was used to deploy the contract. \n\n#### You will find there are 10000000000000 tokens available in your account as below. Because you set \n\n#### decimal as^8 when deploying the contract above, it minted a fixed number of^100000 tokens in the \n\n#### constructor, with one token having a decimal value of 10^8. totalSupply method will return the total \n\n#### supply of tokens minted which should be also 10000000000000. \n\n Make this page better \n\n\n#### MyERC20 is now live! \n\n## 3. Interacting with ERC-20 token from Kaia Wallet \n\n#### You can use Kaia Wallet to check your balance and transfer the ERC-20-compatible KAIROSTOKEN you \n\n#### just deployed. To view your token balance in Kaia Wallet, follow the steps below: \n\n#### Kaia Wallet \n\n#### Open up Kaia Wallet \n\n#### Click on the Token List Icon, and then click Add Token button \n\n#### Paste the address of myERC20.sol contract in the Token Contract Address field under Custom \n\n#### Token tab. \n\n#### Follow the prompts afterwards to add your token. Your Token List modal should like like this: \n\n Make this page better \n\n\n#### Edit this page \n\nLast updated on **Jan 24, 2025** \n\n#### Is this page helpful? \n\n Make this page better \n\n\n",
    " Smart Contracts Sample Contracts ERC-721 \n\n# ERC-721 \n\n## Introduction \n\n#### This tutorial helps you to create an example ERC-721 compatible token that conforms to Kaia Token \n\n#### Standards, especially Non-fungible Token Standard (ERC-721). \n\n#### ERC-721 Non-Fungible Token Standard defines three events and 10 methods as below. \n\n#### supportsInterface of ERC-721 is derived from^ ERC-165 Standard Interface Detection^ and ERC-165 is a \n\n#### part of ERC-721. ERC-721 compatible tokens are the token contracts that implement ERC-721 and ERC\n\n#### 165 interfaces as below. \n\n#### Based on above interface, developers may customize tokens by adding new features and logics, and \n\n#### deploy on Kaia network. For more information, refer to official ERC-721 specification. \n\nIn this tutorial, you are going to implement (^) MyERC721Card.sol which implements a card-type nonfungible token, i.e. (^) MyERC721Card , which is an ERC-721 token. Each (^) MyERC721Card has name and level, \n\n#### e.g. \"King\" with level 1, \"Queen\" with level 1. \n\n#### MyERC721Card.sol is based on OpenZeppelin’s ERC721 implementation. A major part of the code in this \n\n#### tutorial is forked from OpenZeppelin 2.3. \n\n## 1.

    " Transactions Ethereum Compatibility \n\n# Ethereum Compatibility \n\n#### Kaia provides wrapped transaction types to support Ethereum compatibility. Ethereum transaction \n\n#### types in Kaia have the same attributes and RLP encoding schemes with Ethereum’s design except for \n\n#### the single-byte type delimiter called EthereumTxTypeEnvelope. Therefore, users can successfully \n\n#### deploy transactions generated by Ethereum development tools on Kaia. The type delimiter is also \n\n#### omitted when users use eth namespace APIs, so they can use Kaia just as if they were using Ethereum. \n\n#### Using kaia^ namespace APIs, users can deploy and retrieve Ethereum formatted transactions as a type \n\n#### of Kaia transactions without getting confused with the existing Kaia transaction types. \n\n## EthereumTxTypeEnvelope \n\n#### EthereumTxTypeEnvelope is a single-byte prefix for raw transactions that denotes Ethereum \n\n#### transaction types. Ethereum has adopted an extendable transaction type scheme from EIP-2718 and it \n\n#### uses a type numbering system that conflicts with Kaia's. To resolve the conflict between two different \n\n#### transaction type schemes, Kaia has introduced EthereumTxTypeEnvelope which allows for separation \n\n#### and expansion for future Ethereum transaction types. \n\n#### EthereumTxTypeEnvelope is an additional type delimiter and used only for raw transactions and type \n\n#### numbering. It is not used for transaction hash or signature hash. For that purpose, \n\nEthereumTransactionType (^) as defined in EIPs is used. \n\n#### EthereumTxTypeEnvelope: 0x78 \n\n#### TxHashRLP : EthereumTransactionType || TransactionPayload \n\n#### RawTransaction : EthereumTxTypeEnvelope || EthereumTransactionType || TransactionPayload \n\n## TxTypeEthereumAccessList \n\n#### TxTypeEthereumAccessList represents a type of Ethereum transaction specified in EIP-2930. This \n\n#### transactions type contains an access list, a list of addresses and storage keys that the transaction is \n\n#### supposed to access. Since this transaction type exists to support compatibility, it only works with EOAs \n\n#### associated with [AccountKeyLegacy]. EOAs associated with other account key types should use other \n\ntransaction types such as (^) TxTypeValueTransfer , (^) TxTypeSmartContractExecution , and so on. This \n\n#### transaction type can create accounts, transfer tokens, deploy/execute smart contracts or a mix of the \n\n#### aforementioned. \n\n\n##### NOTE \n\n#### Kaia networks can process this transaction type after the EthTxTypeCompatibleBlock \n\n##### NOTE \n\n#### NOTE: This transaction type only supports the format of the Ethereum transaction type. Unlike EIP\n\n#### 2930 , there are no benefits in terms of transaction fee from using access list. \n\n### Attributes \n\n#### Attribute Type Description \n\n#### type uint8 (Go) \n\n#### The type of TxTypeEthereumAccessList that is a \n\nconcatenation of (^) EthereumTxTypeEnvelope and \n\n#### EthereumTransactionType. This must be 0x7801. \n\n#### chainId *big.Int (Go) The destination chain ID. \n\n#### nonce uint64 (Go) \n\n#### A value used to uniquely identify a sender’s transaction.

    " Core Concepts Transaction Fees Execution Gas \n\n# Execution Gas \n\nGas is a sum of (^) IntrinsicGas and (^) ExecutionGas. In here, we would focus on how (^) ExecutionGas is calculated. **NOTE** Execution gas related hardfork changes can be found at the bottom of this page. Go to Hardfork Changes. \n\n## Overview \n\nExecution gas is charged during executing a contract under three distinct circumstances. Sometimes, some policies may be omitted. \n\nThe first and most common is the (^) constantGas. It’s a fee intrinsic to the computation of the operation. Second, gas may be deducted to form the payment for a subordinate message call or contract creation; this forms part of the payment for (^) CREATE , (^) CALL and (^) CALLCODE. Finally, gas may be charged due to an increase in memory usage. Over an account’s execution, the total fee payable for memory-usage payable is proportional to the smallest multiple of 32 bytes that are required to include all memory indices (whether for read or write) in the range. This fee is paid on a just-in-time basis; consequently, referencing an area of memory at least 32 bytes greater than any previously indexed memory will result in an additional memory usage fee. Due to this fee, it is highly unlikely that addresses will ever exceed the 32-bit bounds. That said, implementations must be able to manage this eventuality. Storage fees have a slightly nuanced behavior. To incentivize minimization of the use of storage (which corresponds directly to a larger state database on all nodes), the execution fee for an operation that clears an entry from storage is not only waived but also elicits a qualified refund; in fact, this refund is effectively paid in advance because the initial usage of a storage location costs substantially more than normal usage. \n\n## Opcode Gas Schedule \n\n Make this page better \n\n\nThe fee schedule (^) G is a tuple of 37 scalar values corresponding to the relative costs, in gas, of a number of abstract operations that a transaction may incur. Also, there’s gas items to calculate the gas of the precompiled contracts called by CALL_* opcodes. **Scalar values representing** (^) **constantGas of an opcode Name Value Name in code Opcodes** G_base (^2) GasQuickStep \n\n#### ADDRESS , ORIGIN , \n\nCALLER (^) , CALLVALUE (^) , CALLDATASIZE , CODESIZE , GASPRICE , COINBASE ,^ TIMESTAMP , NUMBER , PREVRANDAO (^) (originally it was DIFFICULTY ), GASLIMIT , RETURNDATASIZE ,^ POP , PC , MSIZE , GAS , CHAINID (^) , BASEFEE (^) , PUSH0 , BLOBBASEFEE G_verylow 3 GasFastestStep \n\n#### ADD , SUB , LT , GT , SLT , \n\n#### SGT ,^ EQ ,^ ISZERO ,^ AND , \n\n#### OR , XOR , NOT , BYTE , \n\n#### CALLDATALOAD , MLOAD , \n\n#### MSTORE , MSTORE8 , \n\n#### PUSH , DUP , SWAP , \n\n#### BLOBHASH ,^ MCOPY \n\n G_low 5 GasFastStep \n\n#### MUL , DIV , SDIV , MOD , \n\n#### SMOD , SIGNEXTEND , \n\n SELFBALANCE \n\n G_mid 8 GasMidStep ADDMOD ,^ MULMOD ,^ JUMP \n\n G_high 10 GasSlowStep JUMPI \n\n G_selfdestruct 5000 SelfdestructGas SELFDESTRUCT \n\n Make this page better \n\n\n Name Value Name in code Opcodes \n\n G_warmStorageReadCost 100 WarmStorageReadCostEIP2929 \n\n#### EXTCODECOPY , \n\n#### EXTCODESIZE , \n\n#### EXTCODEHASH , \n\nBALANCE (^) , CALL (^) , CALLCODE , STATICCALL , DELEGATECALL , TSTORE , TLOAD G_blockhash 20 GasExtStep BLOCKHASH G_jumpdest 1 JumpdestGas JUMPDEST G_sha3 30 Sha3Gas^ SHA3 G_create 32000 CreateGas CREATE ,^ CREATE2 \n\n### Scalar values used to calculate the gas based on memory and log \n\n### usage \n\n Name Value Name in Code Description \n\n G_memory 3 MemoryGas Amount of gas paid for every additional word when expanding memory \n\n G_copy 3 CopyGas \n\nPartial payment for (^) COPY operations, multiplied by words copied, rounded up G_log (^375) LogGas Partial payment for a LOG (^) operation G_logdata 8 LogDataGas Amount of gas paid for each byte in a LOG^ operation's data G_logtopic 375 LogTopicGas Amount of gas paid for each topic of a LOG operation \n\n### Scalar values used to calculate the gas of the particular opcode Make this page better \n\n\n**Name Value Name in Code Description** \n\nG_sset (^20000) SstoreSetGas Amount of gas paid when the storage value when set stora G_sreset (^5000) SstoreResetGas Amount of gas paid when the storage value remains unchanged at zero or is set t zero G_coldSloadCost 2100 ColdSloadCostEIP2929 Amount of gas paid when the storage value is not in accessList R_sclear (^15000) SstoreClearsScheduleRefundEIP3529 G_sreset G_coldSloadCost + TxAccessListStorageKeyG (1900) G_exp 10 ExpGas Partial payment G_expbyte (^50) ExpByte Partial payment when multiplied by ceil(log_256(exponent) G_selfdestruct (^5000) SelfdestructGas Amount of gas paid for a SELFDESTRUCT operation G_callvalue 9000 CallValueTransferGas Amount of gas paid for a nonzero value transfer G_callstipend (^2300) CallStipend Free gas given at beginning o call for a nonzero value trans G_newaccount 25000 CallNewAccountGas Amount of gas paid when creating an account.

First, gas is added according to the transaction type and input. Then, if the contract is executed, opcodes are executed one by one until the execution ends or STOP operation appears. In the process, the cost is charged according to the constantGas defined for each opcode and the additionally defined gas calculation method. \n\nHere, I will briefly explain the gas calculation logic during contract execution using the fee schedule variables defined above. As this explanation assumes a general situation, the unusual situations such as revert appears is not considered. \n\n add constantGas defined in each opcode to gas e.g. if an opcode is MUL , add G_low to gas e.g. if an opcode is CREATE2 , add G_create to gas add the gas which is calculated through additionally defined gas calculation method For LOG'N' , where N is [0,1,2,3,4], add G_log + memoryGasCost * g_logdata + N x \n\nG_logtopic (^) to gas For EXP , add G_exp + byteSize(stack.back(1)) x G_expbyte to gas For CALLDATACOPY or CODECOPY or RETURNDATACOPY , add wordSize(stack.back(2)) x G_copy to gas For EXTCODECOPY , add wordSize(stack.back(3))^ x^ G_copy^ to gas [ **eip2929** ] If an address is not in AccessList, add it to accessList and add G_coldSloadCost G_warmStorageReadCost to gas For EXTCODESIZE or EXTCODEHASH or BALANCE , [ **eip2929** ] If an address is not in AccessList, add it to accessList and add G_coldSloadCost G_warmStorageReadCost to gas For (^) SHA3 , add (^) G_sha3 + wordSize(stack.back(1)) x G_sha3word to gasMake this page better \n\n\nFor (^) RETURN , (^) REVERT , (^) MLoad , (^) MStore8 , (^) MStore , add (^) memoryGasCost to gas For CREATE , add memoryGasCost + size(contract.code) x G_codedeposit + wordsize(initcode) x G_InitCodeWord to gas For CREATE2 , add memoryGasCost + size(data) x G_sha3word + size(contract.code) x G_codedeposit + wordsize(initcode) x G_InitCodeWord to gas For (^) SSTORE , [ **eip2929** ] If a slot(contractAddr, slot) is not in AccessList, add it to accessList and add G_coldSloadCost to gas If it just reads the slot (no-op), add G_warmStorageReadCost to gas If it creates a new slot, add (^) G_sset to gas If it deletes the slot, add G_sreset-G_coldSloadCost to gas and add R_sclear to refund If it recreates the slot once exists before, add (^) G_warmStorageReadCost to gas and subtract (^) R_sclear from refund If it deletes the slot once exists before, add R_sclear to refund If it resets to the original inexistent slot, add G_warmStorageReadCost^ to gas and add G_sset G_warmStorageReadCost to refund IF it resets to the original existing slot, add (^) G_warmStorageReadCost to gas and add G_sreset G_coldSloadCost G_warmStorageReadCost to refund For SLOAD , [ **eip2929** ] If a slot(contractAddr, slot) is not in AccessList, add it to accessList and add G_coldSloadCost to gas [ **eip2929** ] If a slot(contractAddr, slot) is in AccessList, add (^) G_warmStorageReadCost to gas For CALL , CALLCODE , DELEGATECALL , STATICCALL , [ **eip2929** ] If an address is not in AccessList, add it to accessList and add G_coldSloadCost to gas if it is CALL^ and CALLCODE^ and if it transfers value, add G_callvalue^ to gas if it is CALL and if it transfers value and if it is a new account, add G_newaccount to gas if the callee contract is precompiled contracts, calculate precompiled contract gas cost and add it to gas add memoryGasCost + availableGas availableGas/64, where availableGas = contract.Gas gas to gas For (^) SELFDESTRUCT , [ **eip2929** ] If an address is not in AccessList, add it to accessList and add G_coldSloadCost to gas if it transfers value and if is a new account, add (^) G_newaccount to gas Make this page better \n\n\n## Hardfork changes \n\n Hardfork New Items Change \n\n Cancun EVM \n\n BLOBBASEFEE (0x49) opcode BLOBHASH (0x50) opcode TSTORE (0x5C) opcode TLOAD (0x5D) opcode MCOPY(0x5E) opcode kzg (0x0A) precompiled contract \n\n accessList is fully supported, the storage access which are added to accessList put through tx args are became warm \n\n Shanghai EVM \n\n PUSH0 (0x5F) opcode \n\n warm coinbase so the gas cost accessing coinbase is always warm \n\n started to add 2 gas per word of the initcode at Create , Create2 opcodes \n\n Kore \n\n reduction in refunds \n\n- removes refund for SELFDESTRUCT (0xFF), SSTORE (0x55) \n\n- capped the refund to gasUsed/5 (it was gasUsed/2) \n\n increase gas cost for state access opcodes \n\n- accessList is introduced here but it’s not yet supported. \n\n London EVM BASEFEE (0x48) opcode \n\n modExp (0x05) precompiled contract use new gas calculation logic.

    " Advanced Topics Transaction Execution Execution Model \n\n# Execution Model \n\nThis page describes the execution model, the data structures, and the life cycle of Kaia smart contracts. \n\n## Execution Model \n\nTransactions can be generated by platform APIs as described in Platform API Specification. These transactions are sent to Consensus Nodes (CNs) to be stored in a block. The CNs check whether each received transaction is valid. Valid transactions are stored in the transaction pool; otherwise, they are discarded. A CN selects the executable transactions in the current block in its transaction pool and executes them one by one. \n\nTo execute a transaction, the sender must pay some amount of KAIA as a transaction fee. This transaction fee in KAIA is calculated based on gas and a multiplier, i.e., unit price. A gas is the fundamental unit of computation. Every operation executed on a Kaia node consumes a predefined amount of gas. The exact amount of KAIA required for the transaction is calculated by the formula illustrated in Transaction Fees. The transaction can fail if the sender submits a transaction accompanied by insufficient gas. A transaction can also fail if the sender’s account has an insufficient balance. \n\nWhen a transaction is executed successfully, it is included in the current block. A CN gathers transactions until it reaches block gas limit or block time limit. Then, the CN makes a block with the transactions. This step requires filling several fields in the block. For example, it must calculate the hash values of transactions, receipts, state, etc. After all required fields have been completed, the CN generates a block hash. \n\nWhen block generation is complete, the block is propagated to all the other CNs. The other CNs all verify the propagated block and reach consensus on the verification results by using the BFT consensus algorithm. When the verification process completes successfully by the majority of CNs, the block is stored in the blockchain. Because the BFT consensus algorithm satisfies the immediate finality property, the block is final and will never be removed. After a block is finalized, the execution of all the transactions in that block are irreversibly guaranteed, and their execution results can be returned to the sender if requested. \n\n## Enhanced Randomness in Block Proposer and \n\n## Committee Selection \n\n\nKaia has implemented a new mechanism to introduce verifiable on-chain randomness in the block proposer and committee selection processes. This mechanism involves two new fields in the block header: randomReveal and mixHash. \n\nIn this system, block proposers generate and commit to random values. The (^) randomReveal field in a block contains the proposer’s signature, generated using a specific signature scheme, and is calculated based on the current block number being proposed. The mixHash is then computed using this revealed random value along with other block data, creating a source of randomness for the network. The block proposer and committee selection processes utilize this generated randomness. The use of this randomness aims to make the selection processes more unpredictable and fair, enhancing the overall security of the network. One particular use case for this mechanism is allowing block proposers to remain private until the previous block is completed, adding an extra layer of security to the network. The execution flow creates a cycle where each block’s randomness influences future block proposer and committee selections. This introduces an element of unpredictability to these processes while maintaining their verifiability. It’s important to note that while this randomness is used in selection processes, rewards are still distributed at the end of block mining by directly modifying states, based on staking amounts. The randomness determines which validators are selected to be part of the committee that receives rewards, not the amount of rewards distributed. Several security considerations are crucial to this mechanism: To prevent replay attacks, each randomReveal value must be unique for each block. Block proposers must honestly generate and submit their randomReveal to prevent manipulation of the mixHash. Proposers must keep their randomReveal secret until the block proposal to prevent prediction and potential manipulation by other participants. The randomReveal must be properly signed and validated to prevent tampering. This mechanism aims to introduce unpredictability in the block creation and committee selection processes while maintaining verifiability. It’s important to note that while this system provides a framework for enhanced randomness, the specific implementations of proposer and committee selection algorithms using this randomness may evolve over time as the network develops and improves. \n\n### Restrictions on Transaction Execution \n\nKaia Mainnet and Kairos Testnet currently have the following restrictions on the transaction execution: \n\n\n You can set gasPrice of the transaction, but it means it’s the most you can pay. The actual gasPrice will be determined by network. For more detailed information, see gas price overview A transaction which has bigger execution cost than the computation cost limit will be discarded. Please refer to computation cost As of the Shanghai hardfork, there is an additional gas cost for contract creation based on the length of the initcode, charged at 2 gas for every 32-byte chunk of initcode. \n\n### Restrictions on Smart Contract Deployment \n\nKaia implements several restrictions on smart contract deployment: \n\n As of the Kore hardfork, deployment of new contract code starting with the 0xEF byte is not allowed, as per EIP-3541. Since the Shanghai hardfork: Deployment of new contract code is rejected if the initcode length exceeds 49,152 bytes. The length of the new contract code cannot exceed 24,576 bytes. These limitations are based on EIP-3860. Smart contract account (SCA) overwriting over externally owned accounts (EOA) is enabled. \n\n## Data Structures \n\n### Account \n\nAn account in Kaia blockchain platform is a data structure containing information about a person’s balance or a smart contract. Kaia redesigns its account model to provide better DX and UX. Detailed information about the account model can be found here. \n\n### Transaction \n\nA transaction in a blockchain platform is a message sent between nodes that changes the state of the blockchain. Kaia also redesigns its transaction model. Transactions are separated into various types according to their own purposes to find chances of performance optimization and to support the redesigned account model. Detailed information about the transaction model can be found here. \n\n### State \n\nKaia’s **state** is a collection of account states. This state must be the same across Kaia nodes if they have processed the same blocks in the same order. The state is changed when a transaction is executed on a Kaia node. \n\n\nThe table below shows the account data that are stored in the state. \n\n Component Description \n\n nonce \n\n An integer value indicating the number of transactions executed by this account. When submitting a transaction, the nonce of the transaction should be equal to the account’s nonce. \n\n balance An integer value showing the amount of KAIA that this account currently has. \n\n storageRoot A 256-bit hash of the root of the Merkle Patricia Trie that contains the values of all the storage variables in the account. \n\n codeHash \n\n The hash of the account’s bytecode. This value is immutable, which means it is set only when the smart contract is created. If the account is an EOA or an EA, this value is set to the hash of null. \n\n### Block \n\nA block is a crucial element of the Kaia blockchain because the blockchain literally consists of a chain of blocks. The table below shows the components in a block. \n\n Component Description \n\n baseFeePerGas The base fee per gas. This value is returned only when EthTxTypeCompatibleBlock is activated for that block number. \n\n blockScore Former difficulty. Always 1 in the BFT consensus engine \n\n extraData The \"extra data\" field of this block. \n\n gasUsed The total used gas by all transactions in this block. \n\n governanceData RLP encoded governance configuration \n\n logsBloom The bloom filter for the logs of the block. null^ when it is pending block. \n\n number The block number. null when it is pending block. \n\n parentHash The hash of the block’s parent block. \n\n\n Component Description \n\n proposer The address of the block proposer. \n\n receiptsRoot The root of the receipts trie of the block. \n\n reward The address receiving block reward. \n\n size Integer the size of this block in bytes. \n\n stateRoot The root of the final state trie of the block. \n\n totalBlockScore Integer of the total blockScore of the chain until this block. \n\n transactionsRoot The root of the transaction trie of the block. \n\n timestamp The Unix timestamp for when the block was collated. \n\n timestampFoS The fraction of a second of the timestamp for when the block was collated. \n\n transactions Array of transaction objects, or 32-byte transaction hashes depending on the last given parameter. \n\n voteData RLP encoded governance vote of the proposer \n\n## Smart Contract Lifecycle \n\nA smart contract consists of a collection of code (functions) and data (state) that resides at a specific address on the Kaia blockchain. Contract accounts are able to pass messages between each other as well as perform practically Turing complete computation. Contracts exist on the blockchain in Kaiaspecific binary formats. Currently, Kaia supports one binary format --Ethereum Virtual Machine (EVM) bytecode; however, other formats will be supported in the future. \n\n### Creating Smart Contracts \n\nA smart contract can be created in the Kaia blockchain by sending a transaction to an empty address with the binary as data. The binary can be in various formats; however, Kaia currently supports one binary format, EVM bytecode. It is worth pointing out that this transaction requires a payment for execution. The account balance on the sender’s account will be reduced according to the transaction fee model after the transaction has been stored in a block. After some time, the transaction should \n\n\nappear in a block, which confirms that the state it entails reached a consensus. At this point, the smart contract now exists in the Kaia blockchain. \n\n### Executing Smart Contracts \n\nA function of a smart contract can be called and executed either by sending a transaction to the smart contract or by calling the function locally in the node. When a function is called by sending a transaction, the function is executed by processing a transaction. This entails a cost in KAIA for sending the transaction, and the call will be recorded forever on the blockchain. The return value of calls made in this manner is the hash of the transaction. When the function is invoked locally, it is executed locally in the Kaia Virtual Machine (KVM), and the call returns the return value of the function. Calls made in this manner are not recorded on the blockchain; thus, they cannot modify the internal state of the contract. This type of call is referred to as a constant function call. Calls made in this manner do not cost any KAIA. Constant function calls should be used when only the return value is of interest, while a transaction should be used when side effects on the contract state are of interest. \n\nWhen executing a smart contract function through a transaction, gas costs are incurred. The exact gas cost depends on the operations performed by the function and is calculated based on predefined gas costs for each EVM operation. \n\n### Disabling Smart Contracts \n\nBecause smart contracts exist in the Kaia blockchain, they cannot be deleted; they can only be disabled. For now, Kaia has adopted the same process for disabling a Kaia smart contract as is used for disabling smart contracts in Ethereum. For example, the Kaia smart contract for KLVM can be disabled by using the selfdestruct(address recipient) call in Solidity (or the KLVM opcode SELFDESTRUCT ). The Kaia team will also provide ways to disable smart contracts for other execution environments. \n\n### Upgrading Smart Contracts \n\nKaia will provide ways to upgrade a deployed smart contract to address the inconvenient user experience with existing blockchains. For example, deployed services on blockchains are difficult to upgrade. Kaia will provide frameworks and smart contract libraries to enable service providers (SPs) to upgrade deployed services and migrate service information. Kaia will provide this feature carefully by considering the following requirements. \n\n Only authorized accounts or the owner of a smart contract should be able to upgrade the smart contract. Upgraded smart contracts should be able to manipulate existing data maintained by the old smart contract. Other smart contracts that refer to the old smart contracts should be able to determine whether to use newer, upgraded versions of those smart contracts.

    " FAQ \n\n# FAQ \n\n What is Kaia? How does Kaia support Ethereum equivalence? What is Kaia’s gas policy? What is special about Kaia’s account structure? Where can I start dApp development with Kaia? Is Kaia Open Source? How can I initially fund my account? Any Kaia’s Public Node Providers for testing and development? Are there faucets to get test KAIA? How do I check for Public RPC endpoint status? Which wallets support Kaia? What is Mainnet, what is Kairos? Are there any Kaia SDKs? In what languages? Must I install and run an EN (Endpoint Node) to use Kaia? I am running an EN, and node data sync is too slow. Can I use ERC-20 and ERC-721 contracts on Kaia? Where can I get a browser extension wallet like Metamask? Why is my fee-payer account address not derived from the key provided? Where can I find complete working samples of fee-delegation? \n\n## What is Kaia? \n\nKaia is a high-performance Layer 1 blockchain designed for the mass adoption of Web3, particularly in Asia. It offers over 4,000 TPS, immediate finality, and one-second block times. Fully compatible with Ethereum, Kaia enables seamless dApp migration and provides a robust ecosystem with developerfriendly tools, low fees, and strong liquidity from an ecosystem fund. It prioritizes Web2 user accessibility through integrations with major messaging platform like Kakao and LINE. For details, see our White Paper. \n\n## How does Kaia support Ethereum equivalence? \n\n\nKaia is EVM-compatible and supports all Ethereum Cancun EVM features except EIP-4844 blob transactions. It provides the eth namespace RPC API, allowing seamless use of Ethereum SDKs and tools. Kaia-specific transaction types are represented as Type 0 legacy transactions within the eth namespace APIs, so Ethereum SDKs do not need to be aware of them. \n\n## What is Kaia’s gas policy? \n\nKaia uses a dynamic gas fee model that maintains low fees during normal network conditions but adjusts fees based on network congestion. The gas fee can change within a limited range per block, helping prevent network spam while keeping fees predictable. A portion of every transaction fee is automatically burned. The model prioritizes user experience and enterprise-friendliness while maintaining network stability. \n\n## What is special about Kaia’s account structure? \n\nTo provide maximum convenience for dApp developers, Kaia has devised a way to decouple private keys from addresses. As a result, you can easily implement multisig, whereby you create multiple private keys for a single account, with each key having different weights. Each key can be assigned with different roles as well. \n\n## Where can I start dApp development with Kaia? \n\nWhether you are migrating from Ethereum, or building on Kaia from scratch, we support all the necessary tools and infrastructure. You can test your smart contracts on Remix IDE using Kaia Plugin or connect to MetaMask wallet and Kaia Wallet. Kaia’s sdk is available here. You can refer to our tutorials to try building a dApp on Kaia. \n\n## Is Kaia Open Source? \n\nKaia is most certainly open source! Take a look at our Github Organization and you can start contributing to our Kaia Documentation. Read more about our open-source policies here. \n\n## How can I initially fund my account? \n\nYou may purchase KAIA on the exchange. The list of available exchanges can be found here: Coinmarketcap, Coingecko. \n\n\n## Any Kaia’s Public Node Providers for testing and \n\n## development? \n\nRefer to this list for Kaia’s Public Node Providers and the network domains. \n\n## Are there faucets to get test KAIA? \n\nYou can get test KAIA for development and testing purposes here: \n\n Kaia Faucet NODIT Faucet Thirdweb Faucet \n\n## How do I check for Public RPC endpoint status? \n\nSince we cannot guarantee uptime and stability of the endpoints, you can always check for node provider status here: ChainList, Kaia Status. \n\n## Which wallets support Kaia? \n\nKaia is supported by the cold wallet D’cent, as well as a host of hot wallets like Kaia Wallet, MetaMask and more. Please refer to the list here. \n\n## What is Mainnet, what is Kairos? \n\nMainnet is the Kaia mainnet, Kairos is a testnet. Below is information relating to each network. \n\nMainnet: \n\n EN download : Choose the Mainnet package from the download page. Kaiascope : https://kaiascope.com/ \n\nKairos testnet: \n\n EN download : Choose the Kairos package from the download page. Kaiascope : https://kairos.kaiascope.com Kairos Faucet : https://faucet.kaia.io \n\n\n## Are there any Kaia SDKs? In what languages? \n\nKaia Node is Ethereum-compatible, so you can use popular Ethereum SDKs like ethers.js, web3.js, web3py, web3j, or viem. However, Kaia Node also includes extended features with Kaia-specific account and transaction types. \n\nTo take advantage of these features, you can use the Kaia SDKs, which include extensions such as ethers-ext, web3js-ext, web3j-ext, and web3py-ext. These are plugin-type SDKs that extend Ethereum SDKs. If you prefer standalone SDKs, you can consider the Caver SDKs, such as caver-js and caver-java, which are designed for projects where Ethereum compatibility is not required. \n\n### kaia-sdk (Plug-in SDKs) \n\nThese SDKs support JavaScript, Java, and Python, so you can choose based on the language your project uses: \n\n ethers-ext, web3js-ext for javascript web3j-ext for java web3py-ext for python \n\n### caver (Standalone SDKs) \n\nThese SDKs support JavaScript and Java, and are ideal for projects where Ethereum compatibility is not necessary: \n\n caver-js for javascript caver-java for java \n\n## Must I install and run an EN (Endpoint Node) to use \n\n## Kaia? \n\nIt depends on your needs. If you require full control over your node and need to validate blocks yourself, then yes, you’ll need to install and run your own EN. This is the typical setup for most Kaia applications. However, for testing and development, or if you prefer not to manage your own infrastructure, the Kaia API Service (KAS) is a great option. KAS provides access to the Kaia Node RPC APIs for both Kairos and Mainnet, plus additional API services. KAS offers free API requests after registration. Check the KAS pricing page for pricing plan information. \n\n\n## I am running an EN, and node data sync is too slow. \n\nFirst, check if your HW specification meets the system requirements. \n\nSecond, consider downloading chaindata snapshot to skip the time-consuming Full Sync process. The chaindata snapshot is a database snapshot that stores all blocks generated since the genesis. It is updated daily. \n\n## Can I use ERC-20 and ERC-721 contracts on Kaia? \n\nYes. Kaia supports Solidity as a smart contract language. ERC-20 and ERC-721 written in Solidity for Etherem can be deployed and executed on Kaia. \n\nFurther Kaia-specific token standards can be defined. Follow the KIP (Kaia Improvement Proposal) and join the discussion. \n\n## Where can I get a browser extension wallet like \n\n## Metamask? \n\nKaia’s web browser extension wallet Kaia Wallet. Kaia Wallet is a non-custodial wallet with which you can make KAIA transactions and create accounts. \n\n## Why is my fee-payer account address not derived \n\n## from the key provided? \n\nIn Kaia, the account address can be decoupled from the key pair. \n\nCommon use cases are as follows. \n\n The account owner wants to change the key for security reasons. The account has a weighted-multisig or a role-based key that allows having multiple key pairs to control the account. \n\nFee-payer accounts usually have a role-based key. In most cases, the account address is not derived from the RoleFeePayer key. \n\n\n## Where can I find complete working samples of fee\n\n## delegation? \n\nYou can find complete working examples of fee delegation using several different Kaia SDKs: \n\n ethers-ext: fee delegated value transfer example web3js-ext: fee delegated value transfer example web3j-ext: fee delegated value transfer example web3py-ext: fee delegated value transfer example Caver-js: fee-delegation-example \n\nEdit this page Last updated on **Jan 24, 2025** \n\n Is this page helpful? \n\n\n",

    " Tools Wallets Kaia Safe Frequently Asked Questions \n\n# Frequently Asked Questions \n\n## Can I add new owners after creating a safe? \n\nYes! After creating your safe account, Kaia Safe gives you access to manage safe owners, i.e., add, remove, and replace owners, or rename existing owners. \n\nNote: To execute this change, you need to be connected with one of the current owners. \n\nThe steps below explain how to add new owners or signers to your Safe account after its creation. \n\n**Step 1:** Go to **Settings** in the sidebar menu, you ll see the **Manage Safe Account signers** card under the **Setup** section. \n\n**Step 2:** Click the **Add new signer** button at the bottom of the card. Clicking this button would open a new window. \n\n**Step 3:** Enter the **name** of the new owner and paste the **owner’s address**. Then click the next button at the bottom-right of the page. \n\n\n**Step 4:** Set a new signature policy. In this case, you can either change or retain the existing signature policy. The image below shows that 2 out of the 4 owners are required to confirm and execute any transaction. \n\n**Step 5:** Review and submit the transaction. \n\nConfirm that all changes are correct before submitting. You can therefore submit the change by clicking on the **submit** button. \n\nAfter clicking on **Submit** , your connected wallet will ask you to confirm the change. Depending on your existing signature policy, other owners will have to confirm the change just like a regular transaction. \n\n\n## Can I change the number of required signer \n\n## confirmation? \n\nYes! You can change the number of signer confirmations required by following the steps to be shown below. This is important because you might want to change the owners or signers required to confirm transactions associated with your safe account. \n\n**Step 1:** Go to **Settings** in the sidebar menu, you ll see the **Required Confirmation** card under the **Setup** section. \n\nThis shows your current signature policy, and from the image below, 2 out of 4 owners are required to confirm any transaction. \n\n\n**Step 2:** Click on the **change** button. \n\nThis pops up a new window to select your new signature threshold. \n\n\n**Step 3:** Click on the **Submit** button. \n\nNote that depending on your existing signature policy, other owners will have to confirm the change just like a regular transaction. \n\n## How do I add an existing safe? \n\nUsing your exported Safe data, which contains your added Safe accounts, address book, and settings, you can easily add your Safe account. \n\n Note: You must have downloaded your Safe data as shown in the image below: \n\nThe need to add or load an existing safe into the interface varies. These may include: \n\n You want to access your Safe from a different browser. You want to interact with Safe where another party made you an owner. You want to add any existing safe in read-only mode. \n\nLet’s go through the process of adding your existing safe in the following steps. Note: Please ensure that your signer’s wallet is connected. \n\n**Step 1:** Navigate to **Settings** tab. \n\n**Step 2:** Scroll to the **Data Import** card under the **Data** section. Make^ this^ page^ better \n\n\nHere you can either Drag and Drop a JSON file or choose your file as seen in the image above. \n\n**Step 3:** Click on **Import** button. \n\n\nAfter this, you should now have access to your Safe account. \n\n## Common safe Set-up \n\nThis tends to provide some pointers regarding decisions to take when setting up a Safe. These may include: \n\n How many owners? \n\n What threshold? \n\n What wallets are compatible? \n\nThere is no one best response to these three questions, therefore there is no one optimum Safe configuration. Really, it all depends on the particular use case. Nevertheless, we make an effort to offer some suggestions for things to take into account: \n\n**How many owners?** \n\nTypically, having many owner accounts is a smart option. It is good practice for several people to have access to the safe account when groups are managing funds. It is advised for individuals who manage money to have multiple accounts so they can use more than one authentication factor. \n\n**What threshold?** \n\nA Safe’s threshold is the minimum number of owner accounts that must approve a transaction before it can be successfully executed. It is advisable to use a threshold greater than 1, ensuring that at least one additional account is always needed to validate and carry out Safe transactions, rather than allowing aMake^ this^ page^ better \n\n\nsingle account to carry out transactions. As a result, money cannot be moved even if an attacker gains access to one account. \n\nAdditionally, it is recommended to choose a threshold of 51% of the total owners, e.g., 2 out of 3, 3 out of 5, etc. Because of this, even if one owner loses access to their account, users are not immediately locked out of all of their money in the Safe; instead, the other owners can still perform transactions and, for example, replace that lost owner account. One can contend that this serves as a recovery mechanism. \n\n**What wallets are compatible?** At the moment, Kaia Safe is compatible with Kaia Wallet, MetaMask. \n\nEdit this page Last updated on **Jan 24, 2025** \n\n Is this page helpful? \n\n\n",

    " SDKs and Libraries caver-js Getting Started \n\n# Getting Started \n\n#### This documentation is for developers using caver-js v1.5.0 or higher. If you are using an older version, see \n\n#### Getting Started (~v1.4.1). \n\n## Prerequisites \n\n## Dependencies \n\n#### The following packages are required to use the caver-js library. \n\n#### Node.js \n\n#### npm \n\n#### gcc-c++ \n\n#### Solidity compiler \n\n#### Note caver-js can run on Node.js versions 12 and 14. The recommended versions are as follows: \n\n#### lts/erbium (12.21.0) \n\n#### lts/fermium (14.16.0) \n\n#### If you use a different version of the Node (for example, Node v15), utilize the Node Version \n\n#### Manager(nvm) to install and use the version supported by caver-js. \n\n## Installation \n\n#### To try it out, install caver-js with npm using the following command: \n\n**Note** : (^) package.json file should exist on the same install path. If it does not exist, (^) package.json can be generated via (^) npm init. \n\n#### To install a specific version of caver-js, try the following command: \n\n $ npm install caver-js \n\n $ npm install caver-js@X.X.X Make this page better \n\n\n## Starting with caver-js \n\n#### Once you have finished installing caver-js, you can now connect to a kaia Node using caver-js. \n\n#### To practice the examples below, first create a test file in the working directory. \n\n#### You can see the test.js file created in the working directory. \n\n#### Write the following code in test.js. \n\n#### Running the above code gives you the following result. \n\n#### If you see the output of console.log like above, proceed with the steps below. The version number can be \n\n#### different according to the version of the connected kaia node. \n\n### Connecting to a kaia Node \n\n#### You can import the caver-js module and connect it to a kaia Node in the Kairos testnet as shown in the \n\n#### example below: \n\n#### If you are running an EN, you can connect it to your own node by changing the host and port like below: \n\n $ touch test.js \n\n // test.js const Caver = require('caver-js') const caver = new Caver('https://public-en-kairos.node.kaia.io/') \n\n async function testFunction() { const version = await caver.rpc.klay.getClientVersion() console.log(version) } \n\n testFunction() \n\n $ node ./test.js kaia/v1.4.0/linux-amd64/go1.14.1 \n\n const Caver = require('caver-js') const caver = new Caver('https://public-en-kairos.node.kaia.io/') \n\n const Caver = require('caver-js') const caver = new Caver('https://your.en.url:8651/') \n\n Make this page better \n\n\n## Managing Keyrings \n\n#### Keyring is a structure that contains the address of the kaia account and the private key(s). \n\n#### Keyring can be classified into three types depending on the type of key being stored: SingleKeyring to \n\n#### store one address and one private key, MultipleKeyring to store one address and multiple private keys, \n\n#### and RoleBasedKeyring to store one address and one or more private keys for each role. \n\nSingleKeyring defines (^) key property inside, and this (^) key store one private key. \n\n#### MultipleKeyring defines keys property inside, and this keys is implemented as an array to store \n\n#### multiple private keys. \n\nThe (^) keys property defined in RoleBasedKeyring is implemented as a two-dimensional array (empty \n\n#### keys will look like^ [ [], [], [] ] ) that can include multiple keys for each^ role. The first element of \n\n#### the array is filled with the private key(s) to be used for roleTransactionKey , the second element the \n\n#### private key(s) to be used for roleAccountUpdateKey^ , and the third element the private key(s) to be \n\n#### used for roleFeePayerKey. \n\n### Creating a Keyring \n\n#### Generating a SingleKeyring \n\n#### You can randomly generate a single keyring as shown below. \n\n#### Running the above code gives you the following result. \n\n // test.js const Caver = require('caver-js') const caver = new Caver('https://public-en-kairos.node.kaia.io/') \n\n async function testFunction() { const keyring = caver.wallet.keyring.generate() console.log(keyring) } \n\n testFunction() \n\n $ node ./test.js SingleKeyring { _address: '0x3d263c3c0df60c5516f932d244531742f45eed5c', _key: PrivateKey { _privateKey: '0x{private key}' } } Make this page better \n\n\n#### The execution result is shown above. Member variables defined inside the instance can be accessed \n\n#### through keyring.address and keyring.key. \n\n#### Creating a SingleKeyring from private key \n\n#### Also, if you own a specific private key, you can use it to create a keyring as shown below. \n\n#### Running the above code gives you the following result. \n\n#### The result of caver.wallet.keyring.createFromPrivateKey , like the result of \n\ncaver.wallet.keyring.generate (^) above, is a SingleKeyring instance with an address defined inside it \n\n#### and a [PrivateKey] instance in keyring.key. \n\n#### Creating a SingleKeyring with a private key and an address \n\n#### If your private key for your kaia account is decoupled from the address, you can create a keyring using \n\n#### the given address and the given private key like below. \n\n // test.js const Caver = require('caver-js') const caver = new Caver('https://public-en-kairos.node.kaia.io/') \n\n async function testFunction() { // Create a keyring from a private key const keyringFromPrivateKey = caver.wallet.keyring.createFromPrivateKey('0x{priva console.log(keyringFromPrivateKey) } \n\n testFunction() \n\n $ node ./test.js SingleKeyring { _address: '0xf5a9079f311f9ec55170af351627aff0c5d2e287', _key: PrivateKey { _privateKey: '0x{private key}' } } \n\n // test.js const Caver = require('caver-js') const caver = new Caver('https://public-en-kairos.node.kaia.io/') \n\n async function testFunction() { // Create a keyring with an address and a private key const keyring = caver.wallet.keyring.createWithSingleKey('0x{address in hex}', ' 0 console.log(keyring) \n\n // Create a keyring from a KlaytnWalletKey const keyringFromKlaytnWalletKey = caver.wallet.keyring.createFromKlaytnWalletKey console.log(keyringFromKlaytnWalletKey) } \n\n Make this page better \n\n\n#### Run the code in your console like below. \n\n#### Creating a MultipleKeyring with multiple private keys \n\n#### If you want to use multiple private keys, you can create a MultipleKeyring using an address and multiple \n\n#### private keys. The below examples show how to create a MultipleKeyring with multiple private keys. \n\n#### Running the above code gives you the following result. \n\n#### As you can see, _keys has multiple PrivateKey instances in the array. Member variables defined inside \n\n#### the instance can be accessed through keyring.address^ and keyring.keys^. \n\n#### Creating a RoleBasedKeyring with private keys \n\n testFunction() \n\n $ node ./test.js SingleKeyring { _address: '0x17e7531b40ad5d7b5fa7b4ec78df64ce1cb36d24', _key: PrivateKey { _privateKey: '0x{private key}' } } SingleKeyring { _address: '0x17e7531b40ad5d7b5fa7b4ec78df64ce1cb36d24', _key: PrivateKey { _privateKey: '0x{private key}' } } \n\n // test.js const Caver = require('caver-js') const caver = new Caver('https://public-en-kairos.node.kaia.io/') \n\n async function testFunction() { // Create a keyring with an address and private keys const keyring = caver.wallet.keyring.createWithMultipleKey('0x{address in hex}', console.log(keyring) } \n\n testFunction() \n\n $ node ./test.js MultipleKeyring { _address: '0x17e7531b40ad5d7b5fa7b4ec78df64ce1cb36d24', _keys: [ PrivateKey { _privateKey: '0x{private key1}' }, PrivateKey { _privateKey: '0x{private key2}' } ] } \n\n Make this page better \n\n\nTo use different private key(s) for each role, (^) caver.wallet.keyring.createWithRoleBasedKey is \n\n#### used instead. Each array element represents a role described in RoleBasedKeyring. The example below \n\n#### shows how to create a RoleBasedKeyring instance from different keys for each role. \n\n#### Running the above code gives you the following result. \n\n#### Looking at the output above, the first element of the keys array, roleTransactionKey , has three \n\n#### PrivateKey instances, and the second element, roleAccountUpdateKey^ , has one PrivateKey instance. \n\n#### And the last element of the array, roleFeePayerKey , has two PrivateKey instances. \n\n#### Note : Calling functions related to keyring (caver.wallet.keyring) or wallet (caver.wallet) do not affect the \n\n#### actual kaia blockchain platform (kaia). \n\n### Adding Keyrings to caver-js \n\n // test.js const Caver = require('caver-js') const caver = new Caver('https://public-en-kairos.node.kaia.io/') \n\n async function testFunction() { // Create a keyring with an address and private keys defined by each roles const keyring = caver.wallet.keyring.createWithRoleBasedKey('0x{address in hex}', [ '0x{private key1}', '0x{private key2}', '0x{private key3}' ], [ '0x{private key4}'], [ '0x{private key5}', '0x{private key6}' ], ]) console.log(keyring) } \n\n testFunction() \n\n $ node ./test.js RoleBasedKeyring { _address: '0x17e7531b40ad5d7b5fa7b4ec78df64ce1cb36d24', _keys: [ [ PrivateKey { _privateKey: '0x{private key1}' }, PrivateKey { _privateKey: '0x{private key2}' }, PrivateKey { _privateKey: '0x{private key3}' } ], [ PrivateKey { _privateKey: '0x{private key4}' } ], [ PrivateKey { _privateKey: '0x{private key5}' }, PrivateKey { _privateKey: '0x{private key6}' } ] ] } \n\n Make this page better \n\n\n#### You can use a keyring easily by using the in-memory wallet provided by caver-js. The following examples \n\n#### illustrate how to add a keyring to a wallet using a keyring instance and a keystore file exported from Kaia \n\n#### Wallet. \n\n##### NOTE \n\n#### When developing, it’s best practice to use a an account that isn’t associated with any real funds. A \n\n#### good way to do this is to make a new browser profile (on Chrome, Brave, Firefox, etc) and install Kaia \n\n#### Wallet on that browser, and never send this wallet money. \n\n#### Run the in your console. \n\n // test.js const Caver = require('caver-js') const caver = new Caver('https://public-en-kairos.node.kaia.io/') \n\n async function testFunction() { // Using a keyring instance const keyring = caver.wallet.keyring.generate() caver.wallet.add(keyring) console.log(caver.wallet.getKeyring(keyring.address)) \n\n // Using a keystore file const decrypted = caver.wallet.keyring.decrypt({ version: 4 , id: '9c12de05-0153-41c7-a8b7-849472eb5de7', address: '0xc02cec4d0346bf4124deeb55c5216a4138a40a8c', keyring: [ { ciphertext: 'eacf496cea5e80eca291251b3743bf93cdbcf7072efc cipherparams: { iv: 'd688a4319342e872cefcf51aef3ec2da' }, cipher: 'aes-128-ctr', kdf: 'scrypt', kdfparams: { dklen: 32 , salt: 'c3cee502c7157e0faa42386c6d666116ffcdf093c3 n: 4096 , r: 8 , p: 1 }, mac: '4b49574f3d3356fa0d04f73e07d5a2a6bbfdd185bedfa31f37f } ] }, 'password') \n\n caver.wallet.add(decrypted) console.log(caver.wallet.getKeyring(decrypted.address)) } \n\n testFunction() \n\n $ node ./test.js \n\n Make this page better \n\n\n#### Looking at the output above, you can query your keyring from caver.wallet after adding it to \n\n#### caver.wallet. \n\n#### If you have an address and private key(s) to use, you can easily create a keyring and add it directly to \n\n#### caver.wallet via caver.wallet.newKeyring. \n\n#### Running the above code gives you the following result.

The example \n\n#### below shows how to get a receipt using the caver.rpc.klay.getTransactionReceipt RPC call. \n\n async function testFunction() { // Create a value transfer transaction const keyring = caver.wallet.keyring.createFromPrivateKey('0x{private key}') const valueTransfer = caver.transaction.valueTransfer.create({ from: keyring.address, to: '0x176ff0344de49c04be577a3512b6991507647f72', value: 1 , gas: 30000 , }) \n\n // Sign the transaction via transaction.sign await valueTransfer.sign(keyring) \n\n // Send the transaction to the kaia using caver.rpc.klay.sendRawTransaction. const receipt = await caver.rpc.klay.sendRawTransaction(valueTransfer) console.log(receipt) } \n\n testFunction() \n\n // Using a promise async/await const receipt = await caver.rpc.klay.sendRawTransaction(rawTransaction) console.log(receipt) \n\n // Using a promise caver.rpc.klay.sendRawTransaction(rawTransaction).then(console.log) \n\n // Using an event emitter caver.rpc.klay.sendRawTransaction(rawTransaction).on('receipt', console.log) \n\n // test.js const Caver = require('caver-js') const caver = new Caver('https://public-en-kairos.node.kaia.io/') \n\n async function testFunction() { \n\n Make this page better \n\n\n#### Running the above code gives you the following result. When the above code is executed, the receipt of \n\n#### the transaction is shown below. \n\nThe result of the transaction can be found through the (^) status of the receipt.

For more information, see \n\n#### Transactions. This section describes some examples that can be used with caver-js. \n\n### Fee Delegation \n\n#### Kaia provides Fee Delegation feature.

The validation requires your public keys which exactly corresponds to your private key(s). \n\n#### 3. Thus, changing your private key(s) into the new one(s) is always be preceded by changing your old \n\n#### public key(s) to the new one(s). The new public key(s) must be derived from the new private key(s). \n\n#### Keeping the 3 things above in your mind, you can change your private key(s) by following the steps \n\n#### below: \n\n#### 1. Prepare the new private key(s) to create a new keyring. \n\n#### 2. Create a keyring by its type (Single keyring, Multiple keyring, or Role-based keyring) you need. \n\n#### 3. Generate an Account instance from the new keyring. This Account instance holds the new public \n\n#### key(s) for your kaia account. \n\n#### 4. Send AccountUpdate transaction including Account instance to kaia. \n\n#### 5. Finally, replace your old keyring to the new one that was created in Step 2. \n\n#### Please check Account Update for the details. \n\n#### To change your AccountKey, you must provide an Account instance for the account field in the input \n\n#### argument object of caver.transaction.accountUpdate. An Account instance contains the address \n\n#### of the kaia account and the AccountKey to be updated. \n\n#### The code below is an example code that changes the private key(s) you use for your kaia account along \n\n#### with changing AccountKey of your kaia account to AccountKeyPublic.

The first parameter is the threshold, and the second \n\n#### parameter is an array containing the weight for each key. \n\nNow let’s update AccountKey using AccountKeyRoleBased. AccountKeyRoleBased is an (^) AccountKey \n\n#### type that defines the key to use for each role. \n\n#### The AccountKeyRoleBased above is an example of using one public key for each role. As you can see \n\n#### from the code above, each of them corresponds to one private key.

the kaia account’s AccountKey is AccountKeyMultiSig or AccountKeyRoleBased, the person who \n\n#### manages each key can vary. \n\n#### This section describes how to collect signatures and send the transaction if there are multiple signers. \n\n#### To run this example, you need to update AccountKey of the kaia account you use for testing with \n\n#### AccountKeyWeightedMultiSig. Please refer to Account Update for how to update your kaia account. \n\n### Signing sequentially \n\n#### When a transaction is signed using caver.wallet or the transaction’s sign function, signatures (or \n\n#### feePayerSignatures) are defined (or appended) inside the transaction. You can obtain the RLP-encoded \n\n#### string ( rawTransaction ) containing the signatures (and feePayerSignatures) by calling the \n\ntransaction.getRLPEncoding() (^) function of the signed transaction instance. \n\n#### The following example shows how to sign a transaction sequentially with multiple private keys. Let’s \n\n#### assume that AccountKey of the account who sends this transaction is AccountKeyWeightedMultiSig of \n\n#### two public keys, which means this kaia account can use two private key strings, one private key for each \n\n#### user. This is a case that two users share the same kaia account. \n\n#### In the example below, user1 and user2 create a Keyring instances to be used. After that, each uses its \n\n#### own keyring to sign the transaction. The example below uses transaction.sign^ to sign it. \n\n##### ] \n\n const contractInstance = caver.contract.create(abi, '0x{smart contract address}') \n\n const value = await contractInstance.call('get', 'testKey') console.log(value) } \n\n testFunction() \n\n $ node ./test.js testValue \n\n // test.js const Caver = require('caver-js') const caver = new Caver('https://public-en-kairos.node.kaia.io/')^ Make^ this^ page^ better \n\n\n#### Running the above code gives you the following result.

    " Glossary \n\n# Glossary \n\nThis glossary provides explanation on technical terms specific to the Kaia Blockchain. It stands as your goto for understanding numerous terms you will encounter while exploring Kaia documentation, guides and tutorials. \n\n## anchor \n\nA cryptographically secure reference to data stored outside of a blockchain. Anchors can be used to link data from different systems together, or to provide tamper-proof evidence of the existence of data at a specific point in time. \n\n## anchoring \n\nThe process of storing an anchor on a blockchain. This can be done by creating a transaction that contains the hash of the external data, or by creating a smart contract that references the external data (for example, Anchoring in service chain). \n\n## BFT-based public blockchain \n\nThis is a blockchain that utilizes Byzantine Fault Tolerance (BFT), ensuring consensus can be reached even if some nodes fail or act maliciously. The system relies on algorithms designed to handle up to ⅓ of nodes behaving incorrectly or dishonestly, without compromising the integrity of the network. \n\n## block explorer \n\nA web-based tool that allows users to view and search data on a blockchain. Block explorers typically display information such as block height, block hash, transaction hash, transaction sender and receiver, transaction amount, and transaction status. \n\nThe block explorers available in Kaia are Kaiascope and Kaiascan. \n\n## core cell (CC) \n\nAn entity in the Kaia blockchain architecture that is responsible for executing transactions and generating blocks. A core cell typically consists of a consensus node and multiple proxy nodes. \n\nSee also consensus node (CN), proxy node (PN).

Consensus nodes validate submitted transactions and execute valid transactions. \n\n## endpoint node (EN) \n\nA node that serves as an entry point for service chains and DApps to interact with the Kaia blockchain through its exposed RPC APIs. Endpoint nodes synchronize the entire blockchain ledger and allow reading blockchain data or submitting transactions directly to the network without going through a proxy node. \n\n## endpoint node network (ENN) \n\nA group of endpoint nodes that are interconnected \n\n## externally owned account (EOA) \n\nAn account on a blockchain that is controlled by a private key. The private key is held by the user and is used to sign transactions. EOAs are the most common type of account on blockchains and are used by individuals and businesses to interact with the blockchain. \n\nSee also smart contract account (SCA). \n\n## fee delegation \n\nA mechanism in some blockchain networks that enables a user to nominate another account to pay transaction fees on their behalf. This allows the user to submit transactions and have them processed without needing to pay fees directly from their own account balance. \n\n## governance council (GC) \n\nA group or organization formed to establish and maintain oversight and decision-making authority over a blockchain network. A blockchain governance council typically defines tasks such as establishing operational procedures, resolving disputes, approving protocol upgrades, and representing the interests of all stakeholders in the network. Make this page better \n\n\n## inter-process communication (IPC) \n\nA set of techniques for the exchange of data among two or more processes in one or more computers. It is a fundamental part of operating systems and distributed systems, and is used by many different types of software, including web servers, databases, and graphical user interfaces. \n\n## interplanetary file system (IPFS) \n\nA peer-to-peer distributed file system that enables users to store and share files in a decentralized manner. IPFS uses a content-addressing scheme to uniquely identify each file, and it stores files in a distributed network of nodes. \n\n## Kaia Ecosystem Fund (KEF) \n\nA fund established by the Kaia Foundation to support initiatives that contribute to the growth and development of the Kaia blockchain ecosystem. The KEF provides grants and financial support to projects, organizations, and individuals working to expand usage and adoption of Kaia. The goal of the KEF is to advance innovation and community growth around Kaia through funded initiatives. \n\n## Kaia endpoint node (KEN) \n\nSee endpoint node (EN). \n\n## Kaia Infrastructure Fund (KIF) \n\nA reserve fund established by the Kaia Foundation to support its operating expenses and long-term initiatives. The KIF aids in funding the Foundation’s work to further develop and enhance the Kaia blockchain protocol and ecosystem through research, business development activities, education programs and more. \n\n## Kaia Governance Council (KGC) \n\nA council of organizations that are responsible for governing the Kaia blockchain. The GC members are selected by the Kaia Foundation and are required to operate a consensus node on the Kaia network. The GC is responsible for making decisions about the development and operation of the Kaia blockchain, including upgrades, partnerships, and ecosystem development initiatives. \n\n## Kaia Improvement Proposal (KIP) \n\nA design document providing information to Kaia stakeholders regarding new features or processes for the Kaia blockchain network. KIPs are intended to provide a consistent and controlled mechanism for proposing, reviewing and adopting protocol upgrades and innovations. They allow advocates toMake^ this^ page^ better \n\n\ncollaborate with the Kaia community to refine any potential protocol upgrades before being considered for inclusion in the software. \n\nSome of typical examples of KIP are KIP-7, KIP-17, and KIP-37. \n\n## Kaia State \n\nThis is the world state of accounts in Kaia containing the balances, storage variables of the account and the hash of the code or bytecode depending on if the account is an EOA or SCA. \n\n## Kaia virtual machine (KVM) \n\nA virtual state machine that executes Kaia smart contracts. It is a quasi-Turing-complete stack-based virtual machine that is derived from the Ethereum Virtual Machine (EVM). The KVM is responsible for processing and executing smart contracts on the Kaia blockchain. \n\n## Kaia network identifier (KNI) \n\nA unique resource identifier scheme to identify a Kaia node. It consists of nodeID, hostname, port, and discport. \n\n## Kairos \n\nThe public testnet of the Kaia platform. It is used by developers to test and verify their applications before deploying them to the Mainnet. \n\n## proposer \n\nA role assigned to a consensus node (CN) in each round of block creation. The proposer is randomly but deterministically selected to create the next block. The probability of a CN being enlisted as the proposer is determined by the amount of Kaia tokens, or KAIA, that the CN stakes. \n\n## proxy node (PN) \n\nA node that is responsible for relaying transactions from endpoint nodes (ENs) to consensus nodes (CNs). It aids in enhancing the performance of the network by reducing the direct communication load between ENs and CNs. \n\n## recursive-length prefix (RLP) \n\nAn address prefix format where the length of the prefix is included as part of the address information in computer networking, It allows for more efficient routing by eliminating the need to store prefix lengthsMake^ this^ page^ better \n\n\nseparately for each route. Kaia uses recursive-length prefix to represent blockchain addresses. \n\n## remote procedure call (RPC) \n\nA communication protocol that allows a program on one computer to execute code or request services from a program located on another, often remote, computer within a network. \n\n## soul-bound token (SBT) \n\nA non-transferable token that represents a person’s identity and achievements in the Web3 ecosystem.

    " Governance \n\n# Governance \n\n## Kaia Governance: Taking the First Step to \n\n## Decentralization \n\nThe Kaia Governance Council is a council that has the right to decide various governance matters. To secure its reliability, the early members of the Governance Council have been limited to trusted organizations. This was chosen for the sake of efficiency in the platform’s development and stabilization stage. Kaia reached the stage by joining hands with 31 Governance Council Members and a seamless operation of the Kaia Mainnet. \n\nKaia believes that Kaia governance should lead Kaia’s growth aligned with the transition of our world. One of the key transitions in the world is coming from the growth of the metaverse. The technological advancements are ushering in a more metaversified world. In particular, we are witnessing the growth of the influence of non-traditional entities such as Decentralized Autonomous Organizations (DAOs) and builders. As an organization operating on smart contracts without a centralized structure, DAOs will be a core entity in the metaverse. Builders will have more influence by contributing to the operation and growth of the metaverse. \n\nWe are reorganizing our governance structure to better accommodate to the changing world. In addition to traditional enterprises, Kaia is opening up the Membership of the Kaia Governance Council to the non-traditional entities mentioned above. \n\nBy introducing a stake-based governance model and eliminating the Gini Coefficient from Kaia’s voting mechanism, Kaia enables governance participants who can gather more support from Kaia Communities to shape Kaia in line with their preference. Entities who can make a proper decision in a Metaversified world will have more influence in the Kaia GC. We believe DAOs and builders will lead the scene in the future. \n\nTo further enhance participation and representation within the Kaia Governance Council, we are introducing \"Public Delegation.\" This function allows any token holder to delegate their voting power to other voters who will express opinions on their behalf. This mechanism is akin to representative democracy, where elected representatives vote on behalf of their constituents. Users maintain the flexibility to delegate or revoke their delegation at any time, ensuring their voice is heard. \n\nWhen the level of metaversification crosses the critical threshold, Kaia governance will be fully decentralized with various types of entities. Ultimately, Kaia will evolve into a DAO of DAOs and a platform for DAOs to communicate the voices of Kaia Communities through on-chain mechanisms. \n\n\n## Governance Topics \n\nThe main topics that can be decided through the governance structure include the following three areas, and proposals that require additional decision making may be introduced in a regular meeting or temporary meeting for review. The Kaia Governance Council must make decisions that are best for the growth of Kaia. \n\n Technology Matters related to the technical update of the platform. Here the issues on the blockchain’s basic structure (e.g., Account Structure), new features (e.g., L2 solution), or software update schedule are included. Economy Issues relating to additional issuance of KAIA and its distribution structure, changes in transaction fees, and Kaia Ecosystem Fund spending approval etc. are included in this category. Governing Rule The governance subjects and processes, as well as the rules for the responsibilities and rights of governing bodies, are included in this category. \n\n## Governance Process \n\nKaia principally aims for the governance process to occur within the protocol (on-chain). Through this process, the votes will be recorded on the blockchain, and the results will be carried out following the vote. As the platform grows, more matters will be handled through on-chain governance. \n\n### General Governance Process \n\nThe initial governance process proceeds in the following order: proposal introduction, statement of opinion submitted by advisors, voting by council members, and various follow-up procedures depending on the result of the vote. \n\nThose who have the right to introduce proposals can make sure each proposal is voted on by introducing it. Once the proposal is introduced, the advisors must conduct expert analysis on the proposal and submit a statement of opinion with their results. \n\nDuring the initial phase of Kaia governance, the Kaia Governance Council members will have the right to vote on the introduced proposals and will reference the advisors' statements of opinion to vote on what they believe to be the best option. This voting power can be strengthened through Public Delegation, allowing a wider range of token holders to participate in the decision-making process. If the number of votes passes the threshold, the proposal will pass; if not, the proposal will be dismissed. In its initial phase, the voting process may be replaced by a discussion process facilitated by the Kaia foundation. \n\n\nThe follow-up measures for an approved proposal will be led by the chairman, and the chairman has the responsibility to carry out all the proposals that have been passed by the council during his or her term. \n\n## Governance Roadmap \n\nThe bodies participating in governance must act in consideration of Kaia’s long-term benefits rather than just for their personal interests, and they must actively participate in the governance process. Additionally, all participants that contribute to the network as Kaia Governance Council members must secure computing resources that are greater than the platform requirements and stake a set amount KAIA of their own or from third parties. For smooth operations in development and stabilization of the platform, Kaia Foundation will take on many roles in governance related matters in the initial development phase. In the future, however, other bodies will gradually take on greater roles in the decision-making process, and they will have the right to participate independently. \n\n Development Phase : The initial development phase after the mainnet launch must quickly see parameter adjustments, new feature developments, etc. For this to be possible, many issues will be decided through gathering the opinions of the Kaia Governance Council members, service providers, and community members. To secure initial stabilization, Kaia Foundation will lead the decision-making process. Additionally, all decided matters will be transparently shared with the public. Stabilization Phase : The Kaia Governance Council has governing rights on many proposals and this phase will gradually begin starting Jan 2021. For special matters such as those concerning platform development, and matters that directly affect the overall Kaia ecosystem, Kaia foundation may facilitate the discussion and execution. Decentralization Phase : Following the stabilization period, a number of non-traditional entities such as DAOs and builders may be brought into the decision-making process for additional opinions. Public Delegation will play a crucial role in this phase, ensuring a broader and more diverse range of stakeholders can contribute to Kaia’s governance. Decentralization phase may be gradually achieved through multiple stages with different governing rules and participants. \n\nEdit this page Last updated on **Jan 24, 2025** \n\n Is this page helpful? \n\n\n",

    " Smart Contracts Verify Smart Contracts Using Block Explorers \n\n# How to verify Smart Contracts \n\n# Using Block Explorers \n\n## Introduction \n\nUsually, the deployer of a smart contract is the only party with access to the code that was actually deployed, and the public cannot read the source code of a contract until the deployer has verified it. However, this is where contract verification comes in as an important step in the smart-contract development cycle, as it helps improve the transparency (for users), convenience (for developers), and security of deployed contracts. \n\nHaving said that, once a smart contract is validated, block explorers like Kaiascope and Kaiascan also make it possible for the public to interact with the contract’s public methods using the block explorer’s user interface. This is in addition to the public having direct access to the verified contract source code. \n\nIn this guide, we'll take a look at how to use block explorers to verify deployed smart contracts on the Kaia Network. \n\n## Prerequisites \n\n Remix IDE and Kaia Wallet Enough test KAIA from faucet \n\n## Getting Started \n\nIn this guide, we will be going over verifying both single contracts and multi-part contracts on the block explorers that exist in the Kaia ecosystem, viz.: \n\n Kaiascope Kaiascan \n\nWithout further ado, let’s get started! \n\n## Deploying a single Contract \n\n\nTo verify a smart contract, you need to deploy the contract first on the target network. Hence, for the sake of this guide, we will be deploying the contract to Kaia Kairos Testnet. Also, in this tutorial, we will be deploying a simple counter contract named Counter.sol on Remix IDE. The code is shown below: \n\n NOTE You can check this page for a tutorial on deploying smart contracts using libraries on Kaia Kairos Testnet. You may also use a developer tool such as Hardhat, Foundry, Remix or another tool if preferred, to deploy the smart contract to Kaia Kairos Testnet. \n\n## Parameters for single contract verification \n\nVerifying a contract on the block explorers requires some parameters, and these must be considered while deploying the smart contract. The following are some details related to the contract’s compiler and deployment in order to verify a contract successfully: \n\nRemix IDE : \n\n On Remix IDE, navigate to the Solidity compiler tab. \n\n Observe the compiler version used to compile and deploy the contract. Observe the Open Source License Type used in the contract. This means the SPDX license identifier used at the beginning of the Solidity source file. In the Counter.sol file we used // SPDX-License-Identifier: MIT Observe the EVM version used for deploying contracts. (Optional) If optimization is enabled during compilation, take note of the value of the optimization runs parameter \n\n // SPDX-License-Identifier: MIT pragma solidity ^0.8.0; contract Counter { uint256 public count; constructor( uint256 _initialCount ) { count = _initialCount; } function incrementCounter() public { count++; } function decrementCounter() public { count--; } function resetCounter() public { count = 0 ; } } \n\n Make^ this^ page^ better \n\n\n On Remix IDE, navigate to Kaia tab. \n\n (Optional) If the contract constructor method accepts arguments, take note of the ABIencoded form of the constructor arguments Take note of the contract address of the smart contract on the Deployed Contracts tab after successful deployment. \n\n## Deploying a multi-part contract \n\nIt is important to note that deploying a multi-part contract involves the same steps as deploying a single contract. For the sake of this guide, we will be deploying a simple KIP7 airdrop contract named airdropToken.sol. The code is shown below: \n\n //SPDX-License-Identifier: MIT Make this page better \n\n\n## Parameters for multi-part contract verification \n\nThe parameters for verifying a multi-part contract are the same as those for a single contract. However, because they are made up of multiple dependent contracts, we need to pre-process all dependencies of the contract into a single solidity file. This preprocessing is usually referred to as smart contract flattening. \n\nFor this reason, we will have to flatten the contract so it can be verified using the new flattened Solidity file on the block explorer. \n\nRemix IDE: \n\n On Remix IDE, navigate to the File explorer tab. \n\n Select the newly created contract under the contracts folder Click or tap with two fingers to see all commands available on the contract. Select flatten \n\n pragma solidity ^0.8.4; import \"@kaiachain/contracts/KIP/token/KIP7/KIP7.sol\"; import \"@kaiachain/contracts/access/Ownable.sol\"; // the creator of the project mints certian amount of fungible tokens directly to a certa contract TokenAirdrop is KIP7 , Ownable { constructor() KIP7(\"Token Aidrop Demo\", \"TAD\") { } // Airdrop Token function airdropTokens( address [] calldata wAddresses , uint [] calldata tAmount ) public require(wAddresses.length == tAmount.length, \"Must be same lenght\"); for ( uint256 i = 0 ; i < wAddresses.length; i++) { _mintSingleTokens(wAddresses[i], tAmount[i]); } } function _mintSingleTokens( address wAddress , uint amount ) private { _mint(wAddress, amount); } function supportsInterface( bytes4 interfaceId ) public view virtual override returns ( bool ) { return super .supportsInterface(interfaceId); } } \n\n\n Once the code is flattened, you will see a new contract named airdropTokens_flattened.sol. \n\n NOTE There are different tools for flattening a multi-part smart contract into a single Solidity file, such as Hardhat Flattener. Kindly refer to the respective smart contract flattening tool’s documentation for more detailed instructions on its usage. \n\n## Verifying the Contract \n\n\nHaving obtained all of our verification parameters, we will go over the steps for verifying a single smart contract (Counter.sol) and a multi-part smart contract (airdropTokens.sol) on the block explorer in this section. \n\n### 1. Kaiascope \n\nTo verify a single contract and multi-part contracts on Kaiascope, follow the steps below: \n\n**1.1 Verifying a single contract** \n\n1. Goto the search bar of Kaiascope and paste the deployed contract address. \n\n2. Navigate to the **contract tab** on that page. \n\n3. Click on the **Match Contract Source Code** link to submit the contract code for verification. \n\n4. On the contract verification page, make sure your account is connected to either Kaia Wallet or     Metamask. For this guide, we will be using Kaia Wallet. \n\n5. Fill in the contract address in the **contract address field**. Note: This field is usually filled with the     contract address automatically. \n\n6. Select the **compiler version** used for the Counter.sol example. \n\n7. Select the **Open Source License Type** used for the Counter.sol^ example. For Counter.sol     example, select the option, **MIT License (MIT)**. If there was none used, select **No License (None)**. \n\n8. In the **Source Code field** , select **Source Text** and paste the source code for (^) Counter.sol in the text field. \n\n9. Select **True** for **Optimization** if it was enabled during compilation, and fill in the number of runs     under **Optimization Runs** to be **200**. \n\n10. Select the **EVM version** for the contract. For Counter.sol^ example, select the option **Istanbul**. \n\n11. Click on the CAPTCHA at the bottom and the **Sign and Submit** button to confirm and begin     verification. \n\n\n12. After signing the verification request, you will get a verification status notification \n\n\n13. Once verification is done, the result of the verification will be displayed in the browser, and a     success result page with the contract address. Click on the contract address to view the **Contract**     **Source Code** , **Contract ABI** , and **Bytecode**. \n\n\n\n**1.2 Verifying multi-part contract** \n\nVerifying a multi-part contract on Kaiascope is as straightforward as verifying a single contract, except that it requires some additional steps. In this section, we will be verifying the airdropToken.sol contract with the following additional steps: \n\n You can either Select Source Text under Source Code (step 3 of the Counter.sol example) or Solidity File(s) under the Source Code field. In the case of Source Text , copy the code in the airdropToken_flattened.sol and paste it in the text field. If Solidity File(s) , you can download the airdropToken_flattened.sol file on Remix IDE and upload it to the field. \n\na. Source Text \n\n\nb. Solidity File(s) \n\nAfter this, every other step remains the same as verifying a single contract. Having filled in the verification parameter, click on the **Sign and Submit** button to confirm and begin verification. \n\nOnce verification is done, the result of the verification will be displayed in the browser, and a success result page with the contract address. Click on the contract address to view the **Contract Source Code** , **Contract ABI** , and **Bytecode**. \n\n\n\n### 2. Kaiascan \n\nTo verify a single contract and multi-part contracts on Kaiascan, navigate to the contract submission request page. \n\n NOTE Verification of contracts on Kaiascan is currently in beta. \n\n\n**2.1 Verifying single contract** \n\n1. Fill in the **contract address** for the deployed contract (Counter.sol) \n\n2. Select the **compiler version** used for the Counter.sol example \n\n3. Select the **Open Source License Type** used for the Counter.sol^ example. For Counter.sol     example, select the option, **MIT License (MIT)**. If there was none used, select **No License (None)** \n\n4. Make sure to download (^) Counter.sol from Remix IDE and upload it in the **Source Code (Solidity File)** field \n\n5. Select the **EVM version** for the contract. For Counter.sol example, select the option **Istanbul**. \n\n6.

    " Transactions \n\n# Implementing Transactions \n\nThis guide provides a comprehensive overview of implementing transactions on the Kaia network, covering various transaction types, encoding, signing, and network interaction. \n\n## Kaia Transaction Components \n\nKaia transactions generally include the following components: \n\n Components Description \n\n from The sender’s address. Required for most Kaia transaction types due to the decoupling of key pairs and addresses. \n\n to The account address that will receive the transferred value. \n\n value The amount of KAIA in kei to be transferred. \n\n input Data attached to the transaction, used for transaction execution. \n\n v , r , s The cryptographic signature generated by the sender to let the receiver obtain the sender’s address. \n\n nonce A value used to uniquely identify a sender’s transaction. If two transactions with the same nonce are generated by a sender, only one is executed. \n\n gas The maximum amount of transaction fee the transaction is allowed to use. \n\n gasPrice \n\n A multiplier to get how much the sender will pay in tokens. The amount of tokens the sender will pay is calculated via gas * gasPrice. For example, the sender will pay 10 KAIA for a transaction fee if gas is 10 and gasPrice is 10^18. Unit of KAIA is described here. \n\n## Signature Validation \n\n\nBecause Kaia decouples key pairs from addresses, signature validation differs from typical blockchains. The from field is crucial, as it identifies the sender. The AccountKey associated with the from address is used to validate the signature. \n\n## Fee Delegation and SenderTxHash \n\nKaia’s fee delegation feature allows a third party to pay transaction fees. This requires two signatures – one from the sender and one from the fee payer. The SenderTxHash is crucial for tracking feedelegated transactions. It’s a hash of the transaction without the fee payer’s information, allowing the \n\nsender to track the transaction before the fee payer signs it. The sender can use the (^) SenderTxHash to retrieve the complete transaction via the kaia_getTransactionBySenderTxHash RPC method. \n\n## Transaction Types \n\nWhile typical Blockchain platforms provide a single transaction type, Kaia provides multiple transaction types that empower transactions with new capabilities and optimizations for memory footprint and performance. The following table provides an overview of the transaction types available on Kaia: \n\n Basic Fee Delegation \n\n Legacy TxTypeLegacyTransaction N/A \n\n ValueTransfer TxTypeValueTransfer TxTypeFeeDelegatedValueTransfer \n\n ValueTransferMemo TxTypeValueTransferMemo TxTypeFeeDelegatedValueTransferMe \n\n SmartContractDeploy TxTypeSmartContractDeploy TxTypeFeeDelegatedSmartContractDe \n\n SmartContractExecution TxTypeSmartContractExecution TxTypeFeeDelegatedSmartContractEx \n\n AccountUpdate TxTypeAccountUpdate TxTypeFeeDelegatedAccountUpdate \n\n Cancel TxTypeCancel TxTypeFeeDelegatedCancel \n\n ChainDataAnchoring TxTypeChainDataAnchoring TxTypeFeeDelegatedChainDataAncho \n\n## Implementation Details \n\n\n RLP Encoding: Transactions are serialized using Recursive Length Prefix (RLP) encoding before submission. Signatures: Transactions are signed using [Specify signature algorithm, e.g., ECDSA] to ensure authenticity. Examples and RPC Outputs: This section will provide practical examples and expected RPC \n\noutputs for each transaction type. (Note: (^) TxTypeValueTransfer sends KAIA without any additional data, while TxTypeValueTransferMemo allows for including a short memo field along with the transfer.) By understanding these components and implementation details, developers can effectively build applications on the Kaia network.

    " Smart Contracts Import Ethereum Contracts \n\n# Import Ethereum Contracts \n\nIn most cases, you can use Ethereum contracts on Kaia without any modification. However, be aware of the following two issues. \n\n## Solidity Support \n\n Kairos network is currently compatible with London Ethereum Virtual Machine (EVM). Mainnet is currently compatible with London Ethereum Virtual Machine (EVM). \n\n NOTE v1.7.0 Protocol Upgrade incompatible changes including Istanbul hard fork items and Kaia’s own items. It has been enabled from block number #75,373,312 in case of Kairos network and #86,816,005 for the Mainnet. \n\n v1.7.3 Protocol Upgrade incompatible changes including Base Fee from the London hard fork. It has been enabled from block number #80,295,291 in case of Kairos network and #86,816,005 for the Mainnet. \n\n v1.8.0 Protocol Upgrade incompatible changes including Base Fee from the London hard fork. It has been enabled from block number #86,513,895 in case of Kairos network and #86,816,005 for the Mainnet. \n\nBackward compatibility is not guaranteed with other EVM versions on Kaia. Thus, it is highly recommended compiling Solidity code with the correct target option according to the protocol upgrade status. \n\n Kairos: --evm-version london Mainnet: --evm-version london Others(private/service chain): determined according to the protocol upgrade status \n\nPlease refer to how to set the EVM version of solc. \n\nAn example command is shown below: \n\n $ solc --evm-version london contract.sol Make this page better \n\n\n## Decoupled Key Pairs \n\nKaia decouples key pairs from addresses. If user updates account, the private key for a specific account is replaced with another one. Most cases this will not affect your business logic. However if your business logic includes ecrecover, you should consider using validateSender. For more details, refer to here. \n\nEdit this page Last updated on **Jan 24, 2025** \n\n Is this page helpful? \n\n Make this page better \n\n\n",

You can clone this create-next-app template provided by Privy to follow \n\n#### along in this tutorial. \n\n#### An appID from the Privy developer console \n\n## Getting Started \n\n#### The cloned template is a simple Next.js Privy Auth Starter template with three main core files: \n\n#### index.tsx : this file handles the login authentication of users. \n\n#### app.tsx : this file handles the initialization of Privy SDK and wraps our components with a \n\n#### PrivyProvider. \n\n#### dashboard.tsx : this is the page users are redirected to after logging in. It handles everything \n\n#### around testing each login method (Google, Twitter, Email, Wallets). More importantly for this guide,Make^ this^ page^ better \n\n\n#### we will perform certain functionalities when connected using external wallets like MetaMask. These \n\n#### functionalities include: getting user balance, sending KAIA to another account, deploying a \n\n#### contract, interacting with a smart contract. \n\n## Installation \n\n#### To make use of Privy in your dApp, you must install the required libraries and SDK first. Hence, you’ll need \n\n#### to set up ethers.js, and the Privy React Auth SDK. You can use Privy together with either ethers.js, \n\n#### web3.js, viem libraries to communicate with the Kaia blockchain. For the sake of this guide, we will use \n\n#### the ethers.js library. \n\n#### Open up your project folder and run the command below to install the required libraries and SDK: \n\n## Initializing Privy and Privy Provider \n\n#### After successfully installing the needed libraries, next is to wrap your components with a PrivyProvider. \n\n#### The PrivyProvider should wrap any component that will use the Privy SDK. To do so, open up the _app.tsx \n\n#### file and paste the code below: \n\n npm install —save @privy-io/react-auth npm install --save ethers \n\n import '../styles/globals.css'; import type {AppProps} from 'next/app'; import Head from 'next/head'; import {PrivyProvider} from '@privy-io/react-auth'; import {useRouter} from 'next/router'; function MyApp({ Component , pageProps }: AppProps ) { const router = useRouter(); return ( <> < Head > <title>Privy Auth Starter</title> <meta name =\"description\" content =\"Privy Auth Starter\" /> </ Head > < PrivyProvider appId ={process.env.NEXT_PUBLIC_PRIVY_APP_ID || ''} onSuccess ={() => router.push('/dashboard')} > < Component {...pageProps} /> </ PrivyProvider > </> ); } export default MyApp; Make this page better \n\n\n#### It’s important to note that the Privy provider takes the following properties: \n\n#### Your appID , which needs to be updated in your .env file. You can get started with the following \n\n#### test App ID: clpispdty00ycl80fpueukbhl as provided by Privy for test purposes. \n\n#### An optional onSuccess callback which will execute once a user successfully logs in. \n\nAn optional (^) createPrivyWalletOnLogin boolean to configure whether you'd like your users to \n\n#### create embedded wallets when logging in. \n\n#### An optional config property to customize your onboarding experience. \n\n## Connecting Wallet \n\nInside your LoginPage function in your (^) index.tsx file, call the login method which opens the Privy login \n\n#### modal and prompts the user to login. \n\n import {usePrivy} from '@privy-io/react-auth'; \n\n const {login} = usePrivy(); return ( < div > <button onClick={login}> Log in </button> </div> ); \n\n Make this page better \n\n\n## Getting Account and Balance \n\n#### From the previous step above, you’ll realize we logged in by connecting our wallet. In this step, we will \n\n#### retrieve the user’s associated Kaia address. Additionally, you can retrieve its current balance (in KAIA) \n\n#### using ethers.js. \n\n#### In your dashboard.tsx file, paste the code below: \n\n## Disconnecting Wallet \n\n import {useRouter} from 'next/router'; import React, {useEffect, useState} from 'react'; import {usePrivy, useWallets} from '@privy-io/react-auth'; const {ready, authenticated} = usePrivy(); const {wallets} = useWallets(); \n\n useEffect(() => { if (ready && !authenticated) { router.push('/'); } }, [ready, authenticated, router]); \n\n const [balance, setBalance] = useState(\"\"); async function getBalance() { if (!authenticated) { console.log(\"user not authenticated yet\"); return; } const provider = await wallets[ 0 ].getEthersProvider(); const signer = provider.getSigner(); // Get user's Ethereum public address const address = await signer.getAddress(); console.log(address); \n\n // Get user's balance in ether const balance = ethers.formatEther( (await provider.getBalance(address)).toString() // balance is in wei ); console.log(balance); setBalance(balance); } \n\n return ( { ready && authenticated? ( < div className =“App”> < button onClick ={getBalance}>Get Balance</button> < p >{ balance?  User with ${wallets[ 0 ].address} has ${balance} KAIA : \"None\"}</ p </ div > ) : null } ); \n\n Make this page better \n\n\n#### Disconnecting Wallet Once a user has logged in, you can programmatically log the user out through the \n\n#### logout method derived from usePrivy. This will disconnect the current active session from your dApp, \n\n#### returning the user to their initial state. \n\n## Getting User Info \n\n#### Privy offers users the comfort of connecting to a dApp using both web3 wallets and social logins. In the \n\n#### case where a user connects to a dApp using their social account such as twitter, discord, google \n\n#### account etc, you ll have the ability to call user from usePrivy , which will return an object containing \n\n#### key details such as their id, email, wallet addresses, etc. \n\n## Sending Native Transaction \n\n#### You can perform native transactions, like sending KAIA from one user to another. \n\n const { logout } = usePrivy(); \n\n return ( { ready && authenticated? ( < div className =\"App\"> < button onClick ={logout}>Logout</button> </ div > ) : null } ); \n\n const { user } = usePrivy(); \n\n return ( { ready && authenticated? ( < div className =\"App\"> < div > < p > User object </ p > < textarea value ={JSON.stringify(user, null, 2 )} rows={ 20 } disabled/> </ div > </ div > ) : null } ); \n\n const [klayTransferTx, setKlayTransferTx] = useState(\"\"); async function sendTx() { if (!authenticated) { console.log(\"User not authenticated yet\"); return; } const provider = await wallets[ 0 ].getEthersProvider(); \n\n Make this page better \n\n\n## Working with a Smart Contract \n\n### 1. Deploying a Contract \n\n#### You can deploy a smart contract given its Application Binary Interface(ABI) and its contract byte code. \n\n const signer = provider?.getSigner() console.log(await signer.getAddress()); const destination = \"PASTE DESTINATION WALLET ADDRESS\" \n\n const tx = await signer.sendTransaction({ to: destination, value: ethers.parseEther(\"0.1\"), maxPriorityFeePerGas: \" 5000000000 \", // Max priority fee per gas maxFeePerGas: \" 6000000000000 \", // Max fee per gas }) const receipt = await tx.wait(); console.log(receipt); setKlayTransferTx(receipt.transactionHash) } \n\n return ( { ready && authenticated? ( < div className =\"mt-12 flex flex-col gap-5\"> < button onClick ={sendTx}>Send Transaction</button> < p >{ klayTransferTx? KAIA Successfully Transferred with: ${klayTransferTx} h </ div > ) : null } ); \n\n // add to the existing useState hook. const [contractAddress, setContractAddress] = useState(\"\"); \n\n const deployContract = async () => { if (!authenticated) { console.log(\"privy not initialized yet\"); return; } const provider = await wallets[ 0 ].getEthersProvider(); const signer = provider.getSigner(); console.log(await signer.getAddress()); \n\n // paste your contractABI const contractABI = [ { \"inputs\": [ { \"internalType\": \"uint256\", \"name\": \"_initNum\", \"type\": \"uint256\" } ], \"stateMutability\": \"nonpayable\", \n\n Make this page better \n\n\n### 2.

    " Tools Wallets Wallet Libraries Web3-Onboard \n\n# Integrate Web3-Onboard into a \n\n# dApp \n\n## Introduction \n\n### Leveraging a tool like Web3-Onboard, projects and developers may quickly integrate multiple wallets into \n\n### their decentralized applications (dApps). With the help of Web3-Onboard, user onboarding has been \n\n### simplified. Web3-Onboard does have different features, ranging from support for several wallets to the \n\n### ability for users to connect their accounts to different chains or networks and receive real-time \n\n### transaction notifications, et cetera. \n\n### In this guide, you will use Web3-Onboard library to integrate multiple wallets (such as Coinbase Wallet, \n\n### Metamask, WalletConnect, etc.) into your dApp built on the Kaia Network. \n\n## Prerequisite \n\n### A working react project (by executing npx create-react-app project-name ) \n\n### Install the necessary wallets (Coinbase Wallet, Metamask). \n\n### RPC Endpoint: you can get this from one of the supported endpoint providers. \n\n### Test KAIA from Faucet: fund your account with sufficient KAIA. \n\n## Getting Started \n\n Make this page better \n\n\n### Web3-Onboard as a chain-agnostic wallet library, supports all EVM-compatible networks and also \n\n### provides the flexibility of adding new networks to the library. In this guide, we'll use Web3-Onboard to \n\n### add the Kaia Mainnet and Kaia Testnet Kairos to our dApp. With that said, let’s get started integrating \n\n### multi-wallet compatibility using Web3-Onboard into your dApp built on Kaia Network. \n\n## Setting up Onboard and Wallet Modules \n\n### Step 1 : Install @web3-onboard/core \n\n### Step 2 : Import and Instantiate Wallet Modules \n\n### In this step, you can add as many wallets to be supported in your dApp using the wallet modules. But for \n\n### this guide, you will add Coinbase Wallet, WalletConnect, Injected Wallets to your web3-Onboard \n\n### implementation. Refer to this docs for a list of wallet modules that can be added to your dApp using \n\n### Web3-Onboard. \n\n### In your App.js file, instantiate the wallet modules to integrate with your dApp. Note that each module \n\n### has its own unique options parameters to pass in, such as a fallback JSON RPC URL or default chain ID. \n\n### Step 3 : Install and import ethers \n\n### The Web3-Onboard provider can be used with libraries like ethers.js and web3.js. In this guide, we will \n\n### use ethers.js to make Kaia blockchain calls like getting the user’s account, fetch balance, sign \n\n### transaction, send transaction, read from and write to the smart contract. \n\n npm i @web3-onboard/core \n\n npm install @web3-onboard/coinbase // Coinbase Wallet npm install @web3-onboard/walletconnect // WalletConnect npm install @web3-onboard/injected-wallets // Used to connect to Metamask \n\n import coinbaseWalletModule from \"@web3-onboard/coinbase\"; import walletConnectModule from \"@web3-onboard/walletconnect\"; import injectedModule from \"@web3-onboard/injected-wallets\"; \n\n const coinbaseWalletSdk = coinbaseWalletModule(); const walletConnect = walletConnectModule(); const injected = injectedModule(); \n\n const modules = [coinbaseWalletSdk, walletConnect, injected]; \n\n npm install --save ethers Make this page better \n\n\nIn your (^) App.js file, import the ethers package like this: \n\n### Step 4 : Import and Setup Web3ReactProvider \n\n### In this step, you will instantiate Onboard with the created modules and a list of chains to be compatible \n\nwith the library. Open up your (^) App.js file and paste the code below: import { ethers } from \"ethers\"; import Onboard from \"@web3-onboard/core\"; const ETH_MAINNET_RPC_URL = `Paste ETH RPC URL`; const KAIA_MAINNET_URL = `Paste KAIA MAINNET URL` const KAIROS_TESTNET_URL = `Paste KAIROS TESTNET URL` const onboard = Onboard({ wallets: modules, // created in previous step chains: [ { id: \"0x1\", // chain ID must be in hexadecimal token: \"ETH\", namespace: \"evm\", label: \"Ethereum Mainnet\", rpcUrl: ETH_MAINNET_RPC_URL }, { id: \"0x2019\", // chain ID must be in hexadecimal token: \"KAIA\", namespace: \"evm\", label: \"Kaia Mainnet\", rpcUrl: KAIA_MAINNET_URL }, { id: \"0x3e9\", // chain ID must be in hexadecimel token: \"KAIA\", namespace: \"evm\", label: \"Kairos Testnet\", rpcUrl: KAIROS_TESTNET_URL }, // you can add as much supported chains as possible ], appMetadata: { name: \"Kaia-web3-onboard-App\", // change to your dApp name icon: \"https://pbs.twimg.com/profile_images/1620693002149851137/GbBC5ZjI_400x400.jpg\" logo: \"https://pbs.twimg.com/profile_images/1620693002149851137/GbBC5ZjI_400x400.jpg\" description: \"Web3Onboard-Kaia\", recommendedInjectedWallets: [ { name: \"Coinbase\", url: \"https://wallet.coinbase.com/\" }, { name: \"MetaMask\", url: \"https://metamask.io\" } ] } }); Make this page better \n\n\n## Setting up Utils function \n\nIn this guide, we will be making use of the utils functions such as (^) truncateAddress() and (^) toHex(). \n\n### The truncateAddress() function takes in a valid address and returns a more readable format of the \n\n### address passed in. While the toHex() function converts numbers to hexadecimal. The following steps \n\n### below show how to set up and use the utils function in your project. \n\n**Step 1** : Create a (^) utils.js file in the (^) src root folder. \n\n### Paste the following code in the newly created utils.js file. \n\n### Step 2 : Import the functions in your App.js^ file. \n\n## Connecting Wallet \n\n### Inside your App function in your App.js^ file, call the connectWallet()^ method on the onboard \n\n### instance to initiate the onboard popup modal. \n\n export const truncateAddress = ( address ) => { if (!address) return \"No Account\"; const match = address.match( /^(0x[a-zA-Z0-9]{2})[a-zA-Z0-9]+([a-zA-Z0-9]{4})$/ ); if (!match) return address; return ${match[ 1 ]}…${match[ 2 ]}; }; \n\n export const toHex = ( num ) => { const val = Number(num); return \"0x\" + val.toString( 16 ); }; \n\n import { truncateAddress, toHex } from \"./utils\"; \n\n function App() { const connectWallet = async () => { try { const wallets = await onboard.connectWallet(); } catch (error) { console.error(error); } }; \n\n return ( <div className =\"App\"> <button onClick ={connectWallet}>Connect Wallet</button>^ Make^ this^ page^ better \n\n\n### Once you click your Connect Wallet button, you should see a modal that allows you to seamlessly \n\n### connect to Coinbase Wallet and other instantiated wallets from your dApp. \n\n## Disconnecting Wallet \n\nDisconnecting a connected wallet can be achieved by calling the (^) disconnectWallet() method on the \n\n### onboard instance along with the label of the user’s primary wallet. Also, one good practice is to refresh \n\n### the state to clear any previously stored connection data. \n\n </div> ); } \n\n function App() { const connectWallet = async () => { try { const wallets = await onboard.connectWallet(); } catch (error) { console.error(error); } }; \n\n const disconnect = async () => { const [primaryWallet] = await onboard.state.get().wallets; if (primaryWallet) await onboard.disconnectWallet({ label: primaryWallet.label }); refreshState(); }; Make this page better \n\n\n## Accessing connection, account, network \n\n## information \n\n### After successfully connecting your wallet, you can use the onboard.state.get() method to fetch the \n\n### state of your connection stored through the onboard instance. You can also fetch the state during the \n\n### initial connection. Now you can modify the connectWallet() method to return a list of wallet states that \n\n### you can store in your state and use throughout the application. \n\n### Step 1 : import React’s useState \n\n### Step 2 : Modify code within your App function \n\n // refresh state const refreshState = () => { setAccount(\"\"); setChainId(\"\"); setProvider(); // make sure to add every other state declared here. }; \n\n return ( <div className =\"App\"> <button onClick ={connectWallet}>Connect Wallet</button> <button onClick ={disconnect}>Disconnect</button> </div> ); } \n\n import { useState } from 'react'; \n\n function App() { const [provider, setProvider] = useState(); const [account, setAccount] = useState(); const [chainId, setChainId] = useState(); const connectWallet = async () => { try { const wallets = await onboard.connectWallet(); const { accounts, chains, provider } = wallets[ 0 ]; \n\n setProvider(provider); setAccount(accounts[ 0 ].address); setChainId(chains[ 0 ].id); \n\n } catch (error) { console.error(error); } }; \n\n ...^ Make^ this^ page^ better \n\n\n## Switching Networks \n\n### In order to prompt the user to switch networks in your dApps, Web3-Onboard provides a setChain \n\n### method on an initialized instance of Onboard. Note that the target network must have been initialized \n\n### with the onboard instance at the start of your application. \n\n## Sending Native Transaction \n\n### After successfully connecting to a wallet, you can store the provider object returned from the wallet \n\n### connection in a state variable as done in connectWallet() function. You can therefore use this provider \n\n### and signer object to send transactions to the blockchain. \n\n return ( <div className =\"App\"> <div> { !account? ( <button onClick ={connectWallet}> Connect Wallet</button> ) : <button onClick ={disconnect}>Disconnect</button> )} </div> \n\n <div>Wallet Address: ${truncateAddress(account)}</div> <div>Network Chain ID: ${chainId}</div> </div> ); } \n\n const switchNetwork = async () => { await onboard.setChain({ chainId: toHex( 1001 ) }); }; \n\n return ( <div className =\"App\"> <button onClick ={switchNetwork}>Switch Network</button> </div> ) \n\n // add to the existing useState hook. const [txHash, setTxHash] = useState(); \n\n const sendKaia = async () => { \n\n if (!provider) { console.log(\"provider not initialized yet\"); return; } \n\n // this guide uses ethers version 6.3.0. const ethersProvider = new ethers.BrowserProvider(provider); \n\n Make this page better \n\n\n## Interacting with Smart Contracts \n\n### With the Web3-Onboard provider and signer object, you can make contract interactions such as writing \n\n### to and reading from a smart contract deployed on the blockchain. \n\n // for ethers version below 6.3.0. // const provider = new ethers.providers.Web3Provider(provider); \n\n const signer = await ethersProvider.getSigner(); \n\n // Submit transaction to the blockchain and wait for it to be mined const tx = await signer.sendTransaction({ to: \"0x75Bc50a5664657c869Edc0E058d192EeEfD570eb\", value: ethers.parseEther(\"0.1\"), maxPriorityFeePerGas: \" 5000000000 \", // Max priority fee per gas maxFeePerGas: \" 6000000000000 \", // Max fee per gas }) \n\n const receipt = await tx.wait(); setTxHash(receipt.hash) } \n\n return ( <div className =\"App\"> <button onClick ={sendKlay}>Send Klay</button> <div>Send-Kaia Tx Hash : {txHash? <a href ={https://kairos.kaiascope.com/tx/${t </div> ); \n\n // add to existing useState hook const [contractTx, setContractTx] = useState(); const [contractMessage, setContractMessage] = useState(); \n\n const writeToContract = async ( e ) => { e.preventDefault(); if (!provider) { console.log(\"provider not initialized yet\"); return; } \n\n // this guide uses ethers version 6.3.0. const ethersProvider = new ethers.BrowserProvider(provider); // for ethers version below 6.3.0. // const provider = new ethers.providers.Web3Provider(provider); const signer = await ethersProvider.getSigner(); \n\n // Paste your contractABI const contractABI = [ { \"inputs\": [ { \"internalType\": \"uint256\", \n\n Make this page better \n\n\n \"name\": \"_initNum\", \"type\": \"uint256\" } ], \"stateMutability\": \"nonpayable\", \"type\": \"constructor\" }, { \"inputs\": [], \"name\": \"retrieve\", \"outputs\": [ { \"internalType\": \"uint256\", \"name\": \"\", \"type\": \"uint256\" } ], \"stateMutability\": \"view\", \"type\": \"function\" }, { \"inputs\": [ { \"internalType\": \"uint256\", \"name\": \"num\", \"type\": \"uint256\" } ], \"name\": \"store\", \"outputs\": [], \"stateMutability\": \"nonpayable\", \"type\": \"function\" } ] \n\n // Paste your contract address const contractAddress = \"0x3b01E4025B428fFad9481a500BAc36396719092C\"; \n\n // const contract = new Contract(contractAddress, contractABI, provider); const contract = new ethers.Contract(contractAddress, contractABI, signer); \n\n const value = e.target.store_value.value; \n\n // Send transaction to smart contract to update message const tx = await contract.store(value); \n\n // Wait for transaction to finish const receipt = await tx.wait(); const result = receipt.hash; \n\nsetContractTx(result) } \n\nconst readFromContract = async () => { if (!provider) { console.log(\"provider not initialized yet\"); return; } Make this page better \n\n\n // this guide uses ethers version 6.3.0. const ethersProvider = new ethers.BrowserProvider(provider); // for ethers version below 6.3.0. // const provider = new ethers.providers.Web3Provider(provider); \n\n // paste your contract ABI const contractABI = [ { \"inputs\": [ { \"internalType\": \"uint256\", \"name\": \"_initNum\", \"type\": \"uint256\" } ], \"stateMutability\": \"nonpayable\", \"type\": \"constructor\" }, { \"inputs\": [], \"name\": \"retrieve\", \"outputs\": [ { \"internalType\": \"uint256\", \"name\": \"\", \"type\": \"uint256\" } ], \"stateMutability\": \"view\", \"type\": \"function\" }, { \"inputs\": [ { \"internalType\": \"uint256\", \"name\": \"num\", \"type\": \"uint256\" } ], \"name\": \"store\", \"outputs\": [], \"stateMutability\": \"nonpayable\", \"type\": \"function\" } ] \n\n // paste your contract address const contractAddress = \"0x3b01E4025B428fFad9481a500BAc36396719092C\"; \n\n // const contract = new Contract(contractAddress, contractABI, provider); const contract = new ethers.Contract(contractAddress, contractABI, ethersProvider) \n\n// Read message from smart contract const contractMessage = await contract.retrieve(); setContractMessage(contractMessage.toString()) } \n\n Make this page better \n\n\n## Troubleshooting \n\n### Polyfill node core module error \n\n### This error occurs when you use webpack version 5.

With Web3Auth’s excellent user \n\n#### experience, both mainstream and crypto natives may be onboarded in a matter of minutes. \n\n#### As a wallet infrastructure, it provides out-of-the-box support for all social logins, web and mobile native \n\n#### platforms, wallets, and other key management methods. By the end of this guide, you will have \n\n#### integrated Web3Auth into your decentralized web application built on the Kaia Network. To integrate \n\n#### Web3Auth into other platforms (Android, iOS, React Native, Flutter, & Unity), kindly refer to this guide. \n\n#### For a quick start, the complete code for this tutorial is available on GitHub. You can clone or download \n\n#### the repository to follow along. \n\n## Prerequisite \n\nA working react project (by executing (^) npm create vite@latest project-name ---template \n\n#### react-ts ) \n\n#### Install the necessary wallets (Coinbase Wallet, Metamask). \n\n#### RPC Endpoint: you can get this from one of the supported endpoint providers. \n\n#### Test KAIA from Faucet: fund your account with sufficient KAIA. \n\n#### Get your Client ID from Web3Auth Dashboard. \n\n Make this page better \n\n\n## Installation \n\n#### To make use of Web3Auth in your dApp, you must install the required libraries and SDK first. Hence, you’ll \n\n#### need to set up ethers.js, and the Web3Auth Web SDK. You can use Web3Auth together with either \n\n#### ethers.js, web3.js or kaia sdk libraries to communicate with the Kaia blockchain. We'll be using ethers.js \n\n#### for this guide. \n\n## Initializing Web3Auth and Provider Instance \n\n#### After successfully installing the needed libraries, next is to initialize the Web3Auth instance, set the \n\nWeb3Auth **provider** instance in a (^) useState() hook and also the (^) init() function in a (^) useEffect() \n\n#### hook. \n\n npm install --save @web3auth/modal @web3auth/base @web3auth/ethereum-provider @web3auth/d npm install --save ethers \n\n Make this page better \n\n\n#### Import Web3Auth and other dependent \n\n#### packages. \n\n#### Import React hooks (useState and \n\n#### useEffect) and utility functions: \n\n#### useState and useEffect : React \n\n#### hooks for state management and side \n\n#### effects. \n\n#### RPC : Custom utility functions from \n\n#### etherRPC.ts for Ethereum\n\n#### compatible blockchain interactions \n\n#### using ethers.js. \n\n#### Paste your Client ID from the Web3Auth \n\n#### Dashboard. \n\n#### Setup Chain Config : To use Web3Auth, you \n\n#### need to set up a chain config for the \n\n#### selected chain Kaia. \n\n#### Initialize Web3Auth by using the \n\n#### constructor, where you can pass all the \n\n#### configurations of Web3Auth you want. \n\n#### Set the Web3Auth provider instance, \n\n**userInfo** in a (^) useState() hook and the \n\n#### init() function in a useEffect() hook. \n\n## Connecting Wallet \n\n#### Inside your App function in your App.tsx file, call the connect() method on the web3Auth instance to \n\n#### initiate the connection of your wallet. \n\n App.tsx ether… packag… vite.co… \n\n import { CHAIN_NAMESPACES, IProvider, IAdapter, WEB3AUTH_NETWORK, } from '@web3auth/base' import { EthereumPrivateKeyProvider } from '@web import { Web3Auth, Web3AuthOptions } from '@web3 import { getDefaultExternalAdapters } from '@web \n\n import './App.css' \n\n import { useEffect, useState } from 'react' import RPC from './etherRPC' \n\n const clientId = 'BPi5PB_UiIZ-cPz1GtV5i1I2iOSOHuimiXBI0e-Oe_u6X \n\n const chainConfig = { chainNamespace: CHAIN_NAMESPACES.EIP155, chainId: '0x3e9', // Kairos Testnet rpcTarget: 'https://public-en-kairos.node.kaia displayName: 'Kairos Testnet', \n\n function App() { const [provider, setProvider] = (useState < IProvider) | (null > null) const [loggedIn, setLoggedIn] = useState < boolean > false \n\n const login = async () => { if (!web3auth) { console.log('web3auth not initialized yet')^ Make^ this^ page^ better \n\n\n## Setting up Utils function \n\nIn this guide, we will be making use of utils function: (^) truncateAddress(). The truncateAddress() \n\n#### function takes in a valid address and returns a more readable format of the address passed in. The \n\n#### following steps below show how to set up and use the utils function in your project. \n\n**Step 1** : Create a (^) utils.ts file in the (^) src root folder. \n\n#### Paste the following code in the newly created utils.ts file: \n\n return } const web3authProvider = await web3auth.connect() setProvider(web3authProvider) if (web3auth.connected) { setLoggedIn(true) await updateUserInfo() } } \n\n return ( <div className =\"App\"> <button onClick ={login}>Login</button> </div> ) } \n\n export const truncateAddress = ( address ) => { if (!address) return 'No Account' const match = address.match( \n\n Make this page better \n\n\n#### Step 2 : Import the function in your App.tsx file. \n\n## Getting Account and balance \n\nHaving connected your wallet successfully by calling the (^) connect() method on the Web3Auth \n\n#### instance, you can get the user account and its balance by using the provider and signer object. \n\n /^(0x[a-zA-Z0-9]{2})[a-zA-Z0-9]+([a-zA-Z0-9]{4})$/ ) if (!match) return address return ${match[ 1 ]}…${match[ 2 ]} } \n\n import { truncateAddress } from './utils' \n\n function App() { const [provider, setProvider] = useState< IProvider | null >(null); const [address, setAddress] = useState< string >(\"\"); const [balance, setBalance] = useState< string >(\"\"); \n\n const getAccounts = async () => { if (!provider) { console.log('provider not initialized yet') return } const address = await RPC.getAccounts(provider) setAddress(address) console.log('Address:', address) } \n\n const getBalance = async () => { if (!provider) { console.log('provider not initialized yet') return } const balance = await RPC.getBalance(provider) setBalance(balance) console.log('Balance:', balance) } \n\n return ( <div className =\"App\"> <div> <button onClick ={getAccounts}>Get Account</button> <h2> {' '} Address: <span> {' '} {${truncateAddress(address)} || 'Not available'} </span> </h2> \n\n Make this page better \n\n\n## Disconnecting Wallet \n\n#### Disconnecting from the wallet is achieved by using the logout() method on the Web3Auth instance. \n\n#### Also, one good practice is to refresh the state to clear any previously stored connection data. \n\n## Getting User Info \n\n#### A unique feature of Web3Auth is social logins. Once a user login using their social platforms, Web3Auth \n\n#### instance returns some information about the logged in user. Getting the logged in user information is as \n\nsimple as calling the (^) getUserInfo() method on the Web3Auth instance. </div> <div> <button _onClick_ ={getBalance}>Get Balance</button> <h2> Balance: <span> {balance || 'Not available'}</span> </h2> </div> </div> ) } function App() { const logout = async () => { if (!web3auth) { console.log('web3auth not initialized yet') return } await web3auth.logout() setProvider(null) setLoggedIn(false) setAddress('') setBalance('') setUserInfo(null) console.log('Logged out') } return ( <div _className_ =\"App\"> <button _onClick_ ={logout}>Logout</button> </div> ) } const [userInfo, setUserInfo] = useState< _UserInfo_ | _null_ >(null); const getUserInfo = async () => { Make this page better \n\n\n## Signing Messages \n\n#### Having initialised the provider and signer object, users can sign an arbitrary string. \n\n if (!web3auth) { console.log('web3auth not initialized yet') return } const user = await web3auth.getUserInfo() // @ts-ignore setUserInfo(user) console.log('User Info:', user) } \n\n return ( <div className =\"App\"> <button onClick ={getUserInfo}>Get User Info</button> <div> <h2>User Info:</h2> <pre> {userInfo?

    " Tools Wallets Wallet Libraries Web3Modal \n\n# Integrate Web3Modal into a dApp \n\n## Introduction \n\n#### Web3Modal is a simple-to-use library that helps developers add support for multiple providers in their \n\n#### dApps with a simple, customizable configuration. It makes connecting wallets, performing transactions, \n\n#### and managing accounts easy. \n\n#### In this guide, you will use the web3Modal library to integrate multiple wallets such as Kaia Wallet, Klip, \n\n#### Metamask, Coinbase Wallet, etc. into your dApp built on the Kaia Network. \n\n## Prerequisite \n\n#### A working react project (by executing npx^ create-react-app^ project-name^ ) \n\n#### Install the necessary wallets (Kaia Wallet, Coinbase Wallet, and Metamask). \n\n#### RPC Endpoint: you can get this from one of the supported endpoint providers. \n\n#### Test KAIA from Faucet: fund your account with sufficient KAIA. \n\n## Setting up Web3Modal and Wallet Provider \n\n## Options \n\n#### Step 1 : Installing Web3Modal and an Ethereum library \n\n#### Install web3Modal and your preferred library for interacting with the blockchain. In this tutorial, we will be \n\n#### installing @klaytn/web3modal which was derived from Web3Modal and modified to add Kaia Wallet andMake this page better \n\n\n#### Klip wallet. Also, this tutorial will use ethers.js to interact with the Kaia blockchain. \n\n#### Step 2 : Instantiating Web3Modal with wallet provider options \n\n#### Install the wallet providers of your choice. Here we install Kaia Wallet, Klip and Coinbase wallet providers. \n\n#### In your App.js file, import CoinbaseWalletSDK, KaikasWeb3Provider, and KlipWeb3Provider, and \n\n#### instantiate the various provider options to integrate with your dapp. \n\n npm install @klaytn/web3modal npm install --save ethers \n\n npm install --save @coinbase/wallet-sdk npm install --save @klaytn/kaikas-web3-provider npm install --save @klaytn/klip-web3-provider \n\n import CoinbaseWalletSDK from '@coinbase/wallet-sdk'; import { KaikasWeb3Provider } from \"@klaytn/kaikas-web3-provider\"; import { KlipWeb3Provider } from \"@klaytn/klip-web3-provider\"; \n\n export const providerOptions = { coinbasewallet: { package: CoinbaseWalletSDK, options: { appName: \"Web 3 Modal Demo\", infuraId: process.env.INFURA_KEY } }, walletconnect: { package: WalletConnect, options: { infuraId: process.env.INFURA_KEY } } }; const providerOptions = { coinbasewallet: { package: CoinbaseWalletSDK, // required options: { appName: \"Web3Modal Kaia dApp\", // required infuraId: \"NFURA_KEY\", // required rpc: \"https://public-en.node.kaia.io\", // Optional if infuraId is provided; other chainId: 1001 , // Optional. It defaults to 1 if not provided darkMode: false // Optional. Use dark theme, defaults to false } }, klip: { package: KlipWeb3Provider, //required options: { bappName: \"Web3Modal Kaia dApp\", //required rpcUrl: \"https://public-en.node.kaia.io\" //required } \n\n Make this page better \n\n\n#### Step 3 : Instantiate web3modal \n\n#### Then, instantiate Web3Modal by passing in the provider options. \n\n## Establishing Wallet Connection \n\n#### To establish a connection to the user’s wallet, call the connect() method on the Web3Modal instance. \n\n#### We recommend you to wrap this operation around an async function and store the retrieved provider in \n\n#### your state to reuse throughout the app. \n\n##### }, \n\n kaikas: { package: KaikasWeb3Provider // required } }; \n\n import Web3Modal from \"@klaytn/web3modal\"; const web3Modal = new Web3Modal( { cacheProvider: true, providerOptions, } ) \n\n import { ethers } from 'ethers'; import { useState } from 'react'; \n\n function App() { const [provider, setProvider] = useState(); \n\n const connectWallet = async () => { try { \n\n const web3ModalProvider = await web3Modal.connect(); \n\n // this guide uses ethers version 6.3.0. const ethersProvider = new ethers.BrowserProvider(web3ModalProvider); // for ethers version below 6.3.0. // const provider = new ethers.providers.Web3Provider(web3ModalProvider); setProvider(web3ModalProvider); } catch (error) { console.error(error); } }; \n\n return ( <div className =\"App\"> <button onClick ={connectWallet}>Connect Wallet</button> </div> ); } Make this page better \n\n\n## Setting up Utils function \n\n#### In this guide, we will be making use of the utils functions such as truncateAddress() and toHex(). \n\n#### The truncateAddress() function takes in a valid address and returns a more readable format of the \n\n#### address passed in. While the toHex() function converts numbers to hexadecimal. The following steps \n\n#### below show how to set up and use the utils function in your project. \n\n#### Step 1 : Create a utils.js file in the src root folder. \n\n#### Paste the following code in the newly created utils.js file. \n\n#### Step 2 : Import the functions in your App.js file. \n\n export const truncateAddress = ( address ) => { if (!address) return \"No Account\"; const match = address.match( /^(0x[a-zA-Z0-9]{2})[a-zA-Z0-9]+([a-zA-Z0-9]{4})$/ ); if (!match) return address; return ${match[ 1 ]}…${match[ 2 ]}; }; \n\n export const toHex = ( num ) => { const val = Number(num); return \"0x\" + val.toString( 16 ); }; \n\n import { truncateAddress, toHex } from \"./utils\"; \n\n Make this page better \n\n\n## Accessing connection, account, network \n\n## information \n\n#### As it is, Web3Modal does not provide built-in support for Ethereum interactions, such as retrieving \n\n#### connected accounts and network data. Note that to read the user’s address or connected network ID, \n\n#### you must directly request the information from your Ethereum library. In this guide, we’ll be getting that \n\n#### information using ethers.js. One way is to fetch and store this data is when connecting your user to your \n\n#### dapp. \n\n## Disconnecting Wallet \n\n#### Disconnecting from the wallet is achieved by using the clearCachedProvider() method on the \n\n#### web3Modal instance. Also, one good practice is to refresh the state to clear any previously stored \n\n#### connection data. \n\n const [provider, setProvider] = useState(); const [account, setAccount] = useState(); const [chainId, setChainId] = useState(); \n\n const connectWallet = async () => { try { const web3ModalProvider = await web3Modal.connect(); \n\n // this guide uses ethers version 6.3.0. const ethersProvider = new ethers.BrowserProvider(web3ModalProvider); // for ethers version below 6.3.0. // const provider = new ethers.providers.Web3Provider(web3ModalProvider); \n\n const accounts = await ethersProvider.listAccounts(); const network = await ethersProvider.getNetwork(); \n\n setProvider(provider); if (accounts) setAccount(accounts[ 0 ]); setChainId(network.chainId.toString()); } catch (error) { console.error(error); } }; \n\n return ( <div className =\"App\"> <button onClick ={connectWallet}>Connect Wallet</button> <div>Connected To Chain ID: ${chainId}</div> <div>Wallet Address: ${truncateAddress(account)}</div> </div> ); \n\n Make this page better \n\n\n#### It’s important to keep in mind that the dApp state changes as users interact with it, and it’s best practice \n\n#### to subscribe to the events that are released in response. Create useEffect hooks with subscriptions to \n\n#### these events so they can respond appropriately to changes. \n\n function App() { \n\n const disconnect = async () => { await web3Modal.clearCachedProvider(); refreshState(); }; \n\n // refresh state const refreshState = () => { setAccount(); setChainId(); // make sure to add every other state variable declared here. } \n\n return ( <div className =\"App\"> <button onClick ={disconnect}>Disconnect</button> </div> ); } \n\n useEffect(() => { if (provider?.on) { const handleAccountsChanged = ( accounts ) => { setAccount(accounts); }; \n\n const handleChainChanged = ( chainId ) => { setChainId(chainId); }; \n\n const handleDisconnect = () => { disconnect(); }; \n\n provider.on(\"accountsChanged\", handleAccountsChanged); provider.on(\"chainChanged\", handleChainChanged); provider.on(\"disconnect\", handleDisconnect); \n\n return () => { if (provider.removeListener) { provider.removeListener(\"accountsChanged\", handleAccountsChanged); provider.removeListener(\"chainChanged\", handleChainChanged); provider.removeListener(\"disconnect\", handleDisconnect); } }; } }, [provider]); \n\n Make this page better \n\n\n## Switch Networks or Add Custom Networks \n\n#### As established previously, Web3Modal does not have built-in support for Ethereum interactions. In order \n\n#### to add or switch networks, you must directly make a request (via EIP-3085 or EIP-3326) to your \n\n#### Ethereum library. Here is an example of requesting to switch networks and adding the network as a \n\n#### fallback if it is not already present on the user’s wallet: \n\n## Signing Messages \n\n#### Having initialised the provider and signer object, users can sign an arbitrary string. \n\n const switchNetwork = async () => { if (!provider) return; try { await provider.request({ method: \"wallet_switchEthereumChain\", params: [{ chainId: toHex( 8217 ) }], }); } catch (switchError) { // This error code indicates that the chain has not been added to MetaMask. if (switchError.code === 4902 ) { try { await provider.request({ method: \"wallet_addEthereumChain\", params: [ { chainId: toHex( 1001 ), chainName: \"Kairos Testnet\", rpcUrls: [\"https://public-en-kairos.node.kaia.io\"], blockExplorerUrls: [\"https://kairos.kaiascan.io/\"], }, ], }); } catch (addError) { throw addError; } } } }; \n\n return ( <div className =\"App\"> <button onClick ={switchNetwork}>Switch Network</button> </div> ) \n\n // add to the existing useState hook. const [signedMessage, setSignedMessage] = useState(\"\"); \n\n const signMessage = async( e ) => {^ Make^ this^ page^ better \n\n\n## Sending Native Transaction \n\n#### You can perform native transactions, like sending KAIA from one user to another. \n\n e.preventDefault() if (!provider) return; try { const signature = await provider.request({ method: \"personal_sign\", params: [message, account] }); \n\n setSignedMessage(signature); \n\n } catch (error) { console.log(error); } } return ( <div className =\"App\"> <form onSubmit ={signMessage}> <input type =\"text\" name =\"message\" placeholder =\"Set message\" required /> <input type =\"submit\" value =\"Sign Message\"/> </form> <div>SignedMessage: ${signedMessage}</div> </div> ); \n\n // add to the existing useState hook. const [txHash, setTxHash] = useState(); const sendKaia = async () => { if (!provider) return; const destination = “paste recipient address”; \n\n // this guide uses ethers version 6.3.0. const ethersProvider = new ethers.BrowserProvider(provider); // for ethers version below 6.3.0. // const provider = new ethers.providers.Web3Provider(provider); \n\n const signer = await ethersProvider.getSigner(); \n\n // Submit transaction to the blockchain and wait for it to be mined const tx = await signer.sendTransaction({ to: destination, value: ethers.parseEther(\"0.1\"), maxPriorityFeePerGas: \" 5000000000 \", // Max priority fee per gas maxFeePerGas: \" 6000000000000 \", // Max fee per gas }) \n\n const receipt = await tx.wait(); setTxHash(receipt.hash) } \n\n return ( \n\n Make this page better \n\n\n## Working with a smart contract \n\n#### With the Web3Modal provider and signer object, you can make contract interactions such as writing to \n\n#### and reading from a smart contract deployed to the blockchain. \n\n### 1.

    " Core Concepts Transaction Fees Intrinsic Gas \n\n# Intrinsic Gas \n\nGas is a sum of (^) IntrinsicGas and (^) ExecutionGas. In here, we would focus on how (^) IntrinsicGas is organized. **NOTE** Intrinsic gas related hardfork changes can be found at the bottom of this page. Go to Hardfork Changes. \n\n## Overview \n\nA transaction’s intrinsicGas can be calculated by adding up the next four factors. \n\n PayloadGas is calculated based on the size of the data field in the tx. \n\nKeyCreationGas (^) is calculated when the transaction registers new keys. Only applicable in accountUpdate transaction. KeyValidationGas is calculated based on the number of signatures. TxTypedGas is defined based on the transaction types. Before we get into the detail, keep in mind that not all key types apply the keyGases ( KeyCreationGas and KeyValidationGas^ ). **Key Type Are those keyGases applicable?** Nil No Legacy No Fail No Public Yes MultiSig Yes IntrinsicGasCost = KeyCreationGas + KeyValidationGas + PayloadGas + TxTypedGas (^) Make this page better \n\n\n Key Type Are those keyGases applicable? \n\n RoleBased Depending on key types in the role \n\n## KeyCreationGas \n\nThe KeyCreationGas is calculated as (^) (number of registering keys) x TxAccountCreationGasPerKey (20000). Please keep in mind that Public key type always has only one registering key, so the gas would be always 20000. \n\n## KeyValidationGas \n\n KeyValidationGas is calculated as (number of signatures 1) x \n\nTxValidationGasPerKey(15000) (^). Please keep in mind that Public key type always has only one signature key, so the gas would be always zero. A Kaia transaction can also have a feePayer, so the total KeyValidationGas is like this. \n\n## PayloadGas \n\nBasically, PayloadGas is charged with number_of_bytes_of_tx_input x TxDataGas (100). \n\nIn the case of a transaction creating contract, an additional charge of (^) number_of_words_of_initcode x InitCodeWordGas (2) is applied. It is effective since Shanghai hardfork. \n\n## TxTypedGas \n\nThere are three types of transactions in klaytn; base , feeDelegated , and feeDelegatedWithFeeRatio. \n\nFor example, \n\n TxTypeValueTransfer is the base type of the valueTransaction transaction. \n\n KeyValidationGas = (KeyValidationGas for a sender) + (KeyValidationGas for a feePayer) \n\n\nTxTypeFeeDelegatedValueTransfer is a (^) feeDelegated type of the valueTransfer transaction. TxTypeFeeDelegatedValueTransferWithRatio is a feeDelegatedWithRatio type of the valueTransfer transaction. This is important when calculating TxTypedGas: First, check the TxType is feeDelegated or feeDelegatedWithFeeRatio. If the TxType is feeDelegated , add TxGasFeeDelegated(10000) to TxTypedGas If the TxType is feeDelegatedWithFeeRatio , add TxGasFeeDelegatedWithRatio (15000) to TxTypedGas Second, check the transaction creates contract or not. If the transaction creates contract, add TxGasContractCreation (53000) to TxTypedGas. Otherwise, add TxGas (21000) to TxTypedGas. For example, If it’s legacyTransaction and creates contract, the TxTypedGas would be 0 + TxGasContractCreation(53000). If it’s TxTypeFeeDelegatedValueTransfer, the TxTypedGas would be TxGasFeeDelegated(10000) + TxGas (21000) If it’s TxTypeFeeDelegatedSmartContractDeployWithRatio, the TxTypedGas would be TxGasFeeDelegatedWithRatio (15000) + TxGasContractCreation (53000) \n\n## Hardfork changes \n\n Hardfork Change \n\n Shanghai EVM \n\n limit and meter initcode when calculating intrinsicGas \n\n- started to add 2 gas per word of the initcode \n\n Istanbul EVM \n\n make the PayloadGas of legacyTxType consistent with other TxTypes \n\n- Before: PayloadGas=number_of_zero_bytes_of_tx_input x 4 + number_of_nonzero_bytes_of_tx_input x 68 \n\n- After: PayloadGas=number_of_bytes_of_tx_input x 100 \n\n change keyValidationGas calculation logic \n\n- Before: KeyValidationGas=(number of keys - 1) x 15,000 \n\n- After: KeyValidationGas=(number of signatures - 1) x 15,000 \n\n\nEdit this page Last updated on **Jan 24, 2025** \n\n Is this page helpful? \n\n\n",

Kaia Blockchain focuses on transformative changes that will empower not only technology and business but also individuals in the Web 3.0 era. \n\nKaia Foundation^2 and ecosystem participants aim for easier accessibility of blockchain technology and let more people participate in the Web 3.0 revolution. Kaia Blockchain will settle as a trusted stratum that connects people from different backgrounds all over the world. \n\nTo build the infrastructure for the collaborative Web 3.0 playground, Kaia Blockchain will combine powerful integrated community and infrastructure technologies to discover new opportunities and accelerate innovation. \n\n### Mission \n\nOur goal is to build a fairer and more open future by ensuring people greater economic opportunities and the right to participate through blockchain. \n\n### Vision \n\nThe core vision of Kaia Blockchain is to integrate a broad user base, vast on-chain assets, and technology to help builders promptly implement and expand their ideas with successful results. As a platform, Kaia Blockchain provides the tools and environment required by the builders, providing them with the opportunity to introduce creative solutions to a wider public. They plan to create new value by leveraging on-chain assets and pursuing innovation that goes beyond technological limitations. The continued growth and success of the builder community is one of the core goals of Kaia Blockchain. For builders to turn their aspirations into reality, we will be helping builders turn their visions into reality, from \n\nthe ideation stage through to implementation, market entry, and growth. (^) Make this page better \n\n\n## Value Proposition \n\nKaia Blockchain aims to create Asia’s #1 blockchain through the integration of the two mainnets and lead the adoption of Web3, which was the common goal of the two blockchains. This vision can be achieved by helping builders create ideas, grow, and successfully build projects through a wide user base, abundant on-chain assets, and technology leadership as below. Kaia Blockchain provides a robust infrastructure for Web3 projects of all sizes, creating an ideal environment for builders looking to bring innovative ideas to life. \n\n### Wide User Base \n\n1. **Web2 User Accessibility** : One of the biggest problems facing Web3 projects is attracting Web2     users. Kaia Blockchain provides easy access to existing Web2 users through a messenger-     integrated wallet through collaboration with Kakao with 50 million Korean users and LINE with 200     million users in Japan, Taiwan, Indonesia, and Thailand. \n\n2. **Web3 User Accessibility** : In addition to Web2 users, it helps attract Web3 users quickly and easily     to the project by providing more than 1.2 million wallet active addresses and an interface connecting     the users and the project. \n\n3. **Community Building Support** : It helps users gather and build projects through joint marketing with     Kaia Foundation and provides an environment with easy access and usage for users from various     chains. \n\n### Abundant Liquidity Support \n\n1. **Real World Asset (RWA) Linkage** : Real world assets such as gold, ships, and real estate already     exist on Kaia Blockchain. Beyond this, real world assets such as various fiat-backed stablecoins and     bonds will be on-chained, allowing developers to utilize a wider range of assets. \n\n2. **Large-Scale Ecosystem Fund (Kaia Ecosystem Fund):** A large-scale ecosystem fund can be     created based on KAIA and support various sectors requiring liquidity such as Defi and Gamefi. \n\n3. **Chain Native Yield** : Built-in MEV (Maximal Extractable Value) extraction allows KAIA Stakers to     automatically earn MEV profits on the chain. This results in an increase in the chain liquidity and     simultaneously provides a method for burning tokens. \n\n### Top-Level Core Technology and Development Convenience \n\n1. **Top-Level Transaction Finality** : Provides higher TPS and decentralization while maintaining the 1-     second transaction finality.        Make this page better \n\n\n2. **Ethereum Compatibility:** EVM-based dApps can be onboarded without any modifications with the     provision of 100% Ethereum compatibility. \n\n3. **Convenient Account Model:** The account model of Kaia Blockchain enables the assigning of     various keys to accounts, which strengthens account security and improves user experience. \n\n4. **Permissionless and Decentralized Structure** : Kaia Blockchain is converting into a permissionless     validator structure while also increasing the network’s decentralization. \n\n## Token Economy \n\n### Introduction \n\nPublic blockchain platforms are maintained through a token model, which greatly influences the growth direction of the platform. Since blockchains generally do not have a central governing body, it is crucial to motivate the individuals who maintain and develop the blockchain to ensure its continued existence. However, it is unrealistic to expect participants to engage in blockchain security solely for altruistic motivations without seeking any financial gain. Therefore, an incentive system is necessary to motivate blockchain ecosystem participants to maintain and develop the network. \n\nIn blockchains, governance structures drive change. Blockchain platforms must change to keep pace with external developments as available technologies continue to expand and market needs change. Unlike general products developed and maintained by a single company or a central governing body, a public blockchain is not suitable for a single entity to make and implement unilateral decisions. For example, even if the main developers decide on a software update, the miners may not apply it. Therefore, a governance process is needed to collect the opinions of all participants in the ecosystem and make decisions based on the collected opinions in order for the blockchain network to implement timely changes. A stable governance structure must exist for the blockchain to adjust appropriately in response to external changes. \n\nThis chapter explains the token model and governance system of Kaia Blockchain. Kaia Blockchain aims to help builders quickly implement, scale, and achieve successful results based on its large user base, vast on-chain assets, and technology. This document will go over the design principles used to create the current features of Kaia Blockchain and how these features may change. The information provided in this document will be verified through relevant data, and part of this content may be subject to change after sufficient verification and review. \n\n### Design Principles \n\nDesigning the token economy and governance structure of a blockchain platform is complex. First, token economy and governance structures are tested under controlled conditions that do not fully reflect reality. Therefore, it cannot be prepared for all variables. It is also worth noting that the blockchainMake^ this^ page^ better \n\n\nindustry is still in its infancy stage and we have yet to see a successful system that operates over the long term. Kaia Blockchain considered these environmental factors and defined internal principles that are not influenced by external influences rather than maintaining a single specific model. The detailed token economy and governance structure may flexibly evolve in line with the market conditions and regulations. However, the design principles will remain unchanged as a core value shared by all ecosystem participants. \n\nThe core design principles of the token design of Kaia Blockchain are: \n\n Rewarding Ecosystem Contributors: For a blockchain platform to be sustainable and provide great value to users, simply maintaining the network is not enough; the growth of the platform ecosystem is also very important. Therefore, Kaia Blockchain will identify the entities contributing to this growth and provide rewards and support commensurate with the contribution of each participant. This will result in not only contributors to block creation and verification but also service providers who have contributed to the growth of the platform ecosystem receiving reasonable compensation in proportion to their contribution, acting as an attractive incentive for potential external contributors. \n\n Elastic Token Economy: The token economy has numerous active participants with different interests and is greatly affected by various internal and external changes. Therefore, the token economy will be flexible to external variables based on consistent core principles rather than maintaining a single model. Based on these core principles, the token economy of Kaia Blockchain can respond quickly and flexibly to external changes. At the same time, it can support the ecosystem participants to operate stably and align the direction to promote overall growth. \n\n Sustainable Growth: Blockchain platforms must maintain continuous growth. In other words, it must retain the existing and new participants within the ecosystem based on a reasonable incentive model and a system that can flexibly respond to the needs and impacts of rapidly changing markets within and outside the ecosystem. In return, Kaia Blockchain will be able to achieve balanced and stable growth based solely on the contributions of ecosystem participants without any artificial value expansion. \n\n Simplicity: Kaia Blockchain will be explainable simply and clearly. This will allow for quick optimizations and fixes in the future. Its simplicity will allow everyone involved to easily understand the functionality. \n\n Experiment and Optimize with Data: How high should inflation be? What types of rewards should be given for what actions? These questions are difficult to answer without testing and verification. Kaia Blockchain will transparently analyze data obtained and managed on the blockchain, optimize the platform by testing various hypotheses, and transparently share the results through technical reports. \n\n**Kaia Blockchain Tokenomics** (^) Make this page better \n\n\n#### KAIA \n\nKAIA is the platform-native cryptocurrency of the Kaia Blockchain, used to enhance the security of the Kaia Blockchain through staking or to pay transaction fees. Transaction fees are incurred when deploying or executing smart contracts, or when transferring tokens. \n\nKAIA is an essential element and fuel for operating the Kaia Blockchain platform. The users’ KAIA is paid to the validators to execute tasks requested by clients of the platform. In other words, KAIA is an incentive that will ensure developers write high-quality application codes (wasteful codes cost more) and the network remains healthy (validators are compensated for the contributed resources). \n\n**Kaia Blockchain’s Incentive Mechanism** \n\nThe incentive mechanism of Kaia Blockchain seeks to achieve the following goals: \n\n Ability to maintain sufficient economic security and network over the long term. \n\n Support for entities promoting economic activity \n\nIn general, incentives in public blockchains are used to maintain the network and ensure economic security. Maintaining a blockchain requires someone to continuously store block data and process new transactions. Due to this, blockchains such as Bitcoin or Ethereum provide block rewards to miners processing block creation. Incentives are also closely related to economic security. Simply put, economic security is proportional to the cost required to carry out an attack on a blockchain. This cost typically becomes higher as the potential profit of the block creator increases during the block creation process. \n\nIncentives are necessary to ensure a high level of economic security and a well-maintained network. And for the system to operate stably, the value of cryptocurrency must be maintained or rise. If the value of cryptocurrency falls suddenly, the economic security and network stability may decline proportionally. \n\nThe stability or increase in value of KAIA largely depends on its utility. This utility comes from a large number of people using and burning KAIA, which occurs when high-quality service providers actively provide services on Kaia Blockchain. \n\n**Economically Sourced Incentives** \n\nKaia Blockchain provides incentives through the issuance of new KAIA and transaction fees. Additionally, to maintain the value of KAIA as a means of economic support, sustainable methods for distributing and burning KAIA exist. \n\n**Minting** \n\nOn the Kaia Blockchain mainnet, a certain amount of KAIA is issued whenever a new block is created. Each time a new block is created, a certain amount of KAIA will be newly issued, and the target initial annual inflation rate (amount of KAIA newly issued per year / total KAIA token in the market) of Kaia^ Make^ this^ page^ better \n\n\nBlockchain will be set at 5.2%^3. The number of newly issued KAIA per block at this point is not permanently set; it can be changed through governance voting. By default, the inflation rate of KAIA reflects the economic growth rate of Kaia Blockchain. Although the goal is a lower value, the exact value will be determined through the governance. In the mid to long term, the inflation rate and new issuance quantity per block can be automatically calculated and applied based on the inflation algorithm inherent in the chain. \n\n**Transaction Fee** \n\nKaia Blockchain has determined its transaction fee policy to maximize service orientation, usercentricity, and enterprise-friendliness while maintaining network stability. The transaction fee policy takes into account the following points pursued by Kaia Blockchain. \n\n Improved User Experience \n\n We aim to minimize complicated or unnecessary procedures when users pay transaction fees. This will allow users not familiar with blockchain technology to easily use Kaia Blockchain. For example, tasks such as manually entering gas prices should be minimized. The volatility of the transaction fee should also be minimized so that users can use Kaia Blockchain comfortably. \n\n Improved Operational Processes for Service Providers \n\n Service providers can pay for the transaction fees on behalf of users through the unique account model in Kaia Blockchain. Therefore, business convenience for dApp service providers is also a major consideration in fee policy. The basic elements to reduce the burden on service providers are low transaction fees and low volatility fee policies. The low fee is to assist in the expansion of services using the fee delegation feature in the Kaia account model, while the low volatility is to help predict business costs due to the payment fee. \n\n Protection against Network Attacks \n\n Blockchain data storage and computation incur costs. Without transaction fees, attackers may DDoS or spam attack the blockchain by sending meaningless transactions. To prevent meaningless transactions, a reasonable fee will be imposed on transactions. \n\nKaia Blockchain applies a dynamic gas fee model to the network to achieve the above goals. In the dynamic gas fee model of Kaia Blockchain, a low fee is applied in general cases where there are not many transactions on the network. However, in special situations such as a rapid increase in transactions on the network or a DDoS or spam attack, the gas fee increases. This results in a reduction of meaningless transactions. The dynamic gas fee model could change the gas fee per block unit dynamically depending on the transaction congestion within the network, but the range of change is predictable to some extent. Transactions entered into a block have transaction fees calculated with an identical block gas fee (baseFee), and only transactions with a gas fee greater than or equal to the block gas fee can beMake this page better \n\n\nentered into the block. Block gas fees automatically increase or decrease depending on the gas usage of the previous block with the current maximum fluctuation set to 5%. A portion of the transaction fee used in each block is set to be automatically burned. Various parameters of the dynamic gas fee model can be changed via the governance function. \n\nThe transaction fees for Kaia Blockchain are currently determined by applying a dynamic gas fee model. However, a new gas fee model or transaction fee policy may be required according to the environmental changes. If necessary, changes to the gas fee model or transaction fee policy of Kaia Blockchain will be made through the governance process. \n\n**Block Reward Distribution** \n\nThe block reward for each block is determined by the sum of the KAIA issued at the time of block creation and the transaction fee. This is distributed as follows. However, the specific ratio and category of the block reward distribution may be changed by governance. \n\n Validators and Community: 50% Of the 50%, 20% is block proposer rewards Of the 50%, 80% is staking rewards KEF (Kaia Ecosystem Fund): 25% KIF (Kaia Infrastructure Fund): 25% \n\n**Burning** \n\nThe method for maintaining or enhancing the KAIA value is an essential element of any incentive structure based on KAIA. In Kaia Blockchain’s ecosystem growth stage, the additional issuance of the KAIA motivates the ecosystem members to participate. However, a method to control the circulation volume is necessary for it to operate as a long-term sustainable incentive. Kaia Blockchain 3-Layer Burn Model prevents excessive inflation. The 3-Layer Burn Model is an extensive concept that includes not only the inherent burning function of Kaia Blockchain but also the burning concept that can occur through relationships with ecosystem projects. This extensive burn model will effectively regulate circulation volume and provide stable value incentives to the network participants when the Kaia Blockchain ecosystem reaches maturity. The description of each Layer is as follows. \n\n1. Transaction-Based Burning \n\nThis is the default burning method provided by Kaia Blockchain. Users generate transactions to use the blockchain and a portion of the transaction fee is automatically burned. Since transaction-based burning can be interpreted as reduced profits of the node operators, the burning extent is adjusted through agreement and consensus among key network participants through on-chain governance. \n\n2. MEV(Maximal Extractable Value) Burning \n\nA validator may receive additional profits (e.g. maximal extractable value) by taking advantage of the fact that they can determine the transaction order during the block proposal process. This structure \n\n Make this page better \n\n\ncan escalate into issues of censorship or unfairness. As a result, Kaia Blockchain seeks to share the authority of the validator among all users through the implementation of technologies such as on-chain auctions. Part of the profit generated in this process will be burned due to it being generated through a special structural qualification called a validator. \n\n3. Business-Based Burning \n\nBusiness-based burning is not an inherent function of Kaia Blockchain. Rather it is implemented through the ecosystem services and business relationships. Ecosystem services can receive support from protocols such as Kaia Ecosystem Fund to initially accelerate growth. Additionally, the value of KAIA or the activation of Kaia Blockchain affects the activation of services considering services utilize blockchain functions. Kaia Blockchain encourages the ecosystem services to install the concept of burning KAIA within the service to ensure that the service and blockchain maintain the value of KAIA under the same goal. \n\n### Validator Incentives \n\nValidators are operators in Kaia Blockchain who are responsible for block creation and verification based on the consensus algorithm. Validators are required to stake at least 5 million KAIA on the nodes they operate. In addition, validators participate in the on-chain vote of Kaia Blockchain and have the qualifications of GC (Governance Council), which makes key decisions in the ecosystem. In the future, the concepts of validator participating in block creation and GC participating in decision-making will be separated, so that anyone meeting certain conditions could participate in block creation and verification even if they are not a GC. Research and development of building this permissionless network is in progress. \n\nTwo types of incentives are provided to encourage validators to operate nodes: block proposer rewards and staking rewards. \n\n Block proposer rewards are for the act of participating in block creation and verification. At the time of block creation, an identical amount of KAIA will be distributed to all validators activated on the network. 10% (20% of the 50% Validator and Community Rewards) of the total annual inflation issued will be allocated as block proposer rewards. However, the size of the reward in a specific block may vary depending on the number of validators active at a specific time. \n\n Staking rewards are for staking KAIAs and contributing to the network stability and economic stability of Kaia Blockchain. The size of the reward is determined in proportion to the amount staked by a specific validator to the total amount of KAIA staked by all validators. However, the 5 million KAIA staked by each validator as an obligation is not reflected in determining the staking reward size. 40% of the total inflation will be allocated as staking rewards. The size of the rewards in a specific block may vary depending on the number of the total KAIA staked by the validators active at a specific time. \n\n**Kaia Blockchain Validator Reward Mechanism** \n\n Make this page better \n\n\nEvery block will have a committee made up of randomly selected validators. Each committee will have one member to act as a proposer, and all other committee members will act as verifiers. When a block is successfully created and added to Kaia Blockchain, the proposer of that block will be rewarded with 10% (20% of the 50% Validator and Community Rewards) of the total annual inflation issued and additional transaction fees. With regard to transaction fees, if the total amount of transaction fees incurred in one block is less than the block reward, the fees will be burned. If the transaction fee exceeds the block reward, half of the exceeded amount will be burned and the remaining half will be rewarded to the block proposer. Staking rewards equivalent to 40% (80% of the 50% Validator and Community Rewards) of the total annual inflation issued are shared among the validators in proportion to their staking amount. As long as the Kaia Blockchain validators meet the minimum 5 million KAIA staking requirement, they are free to stake or unstake their KAIA. Staking information changed within the staking update cycle will have a final update in the last block of each cycle. Another cycle is required for the updated information to be reflected in the block incentive. For example, staking information added at block 80,000 will be last updated at block 86,400 and reflected in incentives starting at block 172,800. A one-week delay is required to withdraw the staked KAIA to prevent any immediate withdrawals by malicious members. \n\n### Kaia Blockchain Fund \n\n**Background** \n\nThe financial resources of the Kaia Blockchain ecosystem are reorganized and operated into the Kaia Ecosystem Fund (KEF) and Kaia Infrastructure Fund (KIF). Both KEF and KIF will be used to establish stable integrated governance and an active ecosystem and will be transparently executed according to the agreed-upon ratio. The usage plan of the ecosystem resources will be shared with the community in advance. Especially for KEF, individual expenditures will be executed with GC approval. This will allow all ecosystem participants to be proactively aware of the impact of the ecosystem resource execution. \n\n**Kaia Ecosystem Fund** \n\n**Definition** \n\nKaia Ecosystem Fund (KEF) is a financial resource used to ensure the sustainability of Kaia Blockchain mainnet by strengthening the basic ecosystem infrastructure, supporting developers, and returning profits through indirect investments back to the ecosystem. For this purpose, 25% of the total KAIA issued when creating a block will be distributed to KEF. KEF can only execute funds for agreed purposes with prior approval from the governance with all execution details being transparently disclosed. \n\n**Usage** \n\nThe uses of KEF are categorized as follows: \n\n1. Service Contribution Reward (SCR): This reward is given to service developers or users operating on     the integrated ecosystem, as compensation for directly or indirectly contributing to the     enhancement of the ecosystem’s value. Make this page better \n\n\n2. Developer Community Development: This includes support for various hackathons, operation of     development education programs, collaborative research with academia, and collaborations with     various DAOs. \n\n3. Ecosystem Services and Infrastructure Development: This involves the development of services     with clear utilities, support for marketing, and securing essential infrastructure for the ecosystem. \n\n4. KEF Indirect Investment: This involves medium to long-term investments carried out indirectly     through delegation to professional crypto Venture Capitals. A portion of the profits generated from     the recovery of investment amounts is either burned or returned to the Kaia Blockchain ecosystem. \n\n5. Governance Committee Budget: This budget is allocated for the operation of committees in specific     sectors such as Gaming, DeFi, and Community. The committees aim to grow the Kaia Blockchain     ecosystem in their respective sectors through expertise in investing, marketing, grants, and     providing liquidity. \n\n6. Other ecosystem and community-building activities \n\n**Execution Method** \n\nKEF operates under a system where the Governance Council (GC) reviews and approves the use of its funds. The budget executed through the foundation is managed through the following process: \n\n1. Each quarter, necessary budgets by category of expenditure are reported to and approved by the     GC. \n\n2. Within the approved budget limits, specific expenditures are also approved individually by the GC. \n\n3. Details of the expenditures are transparently disclosed after their use. \n\nEven if not through the foundation, new proposals for the use of KEF can be made via the GC, and these specific proposals will also require individual approval by the GC. Plans are in place to develop and enhance a structure that allows more ecosystem participants to efficiently propose and participate in the use of KEF. Additionally, for some categories requiring more specialized and rapid decision-making, separate governance committees may operate. \n\n**Kaia Infrastructure Fund** \n\n**Definition** \n\nKaia Infrastructure Fund (KIF) is a financial resource used for purposes such as R&D, ecosystem acceleration, and foundation operation. For this purpose, 25% of the total KAIA issued when creating a block will be distributed to KIF. \n\nKIF is executed by the foundation through an internal control system after a prior announcement of the budget plan for each detailed category with all execution details being transparently disclosed.^ Make^ this^ page^ better \n\n\n**Usage** \n\nThe uses of KIF are categorized as follows: \n\n1. Mainnet and Essential Infrastructure R&D: Advance research on the latest technologies related to     mainnet and infrastructure, foundation-led service development, infrastructure establishment, etc. \n\n2. Ecosystem Acceleration: Token swap, financial support for small-scale Kaia Blockchain ecosystem     partners, attraction of new GC, provision of market liquidity, etc. \n\n3. Operation of Kaia Foundation: Operating costs (various service costs such as development,     accounting, legal affairs, as well as IT infrastructure operation costs, marketing costs, labor costs,     etc.), financial management, fundraising, etc. \n\n**Execution Method** \n\nThe foundation directly establishes a budget plan and executes the funds accordingly for KIF. To ensure transparent execution, the foundation discloses the budget plans and execution details in advance and afterward. \n\n1. Establishment of the budget and fund execution plan by the foundation \n\n2. Disclosure of the budget plans by detailed category \n\n3. Disclosure of the execution details after executing the funds through an internal control system by     the foundation \n\n### KAIA Issuance/Distribution Plan \n\nAs the Klaytn and Finschia ecosystems merge, KLAY and FNSA, which were the base coins of each ecosystem, will also be consolidated into KAIA. Consequently, the issuance and circulation plan for KAIA will inherit the plans from KLAY and FNSA. This section will examine the historical issuance and circulation data of KLAY and FNSA and, based on this, will outline the plan for the issuance and circulation of KAIA. \n\n**KLAY Issuance/Distribution Status** \n\n**KLAY Issuance and Burning Volume** \n\nOn June 24, 2019, a total of 10 billion KLAY were issued on the genesis block at the launch of the mainnet of the Klaytn Blockchain. After the launch of the mainnet, a 3% annual inflation rate was applied based on the genesis issuance volume, newly issuing 9.6 KLAY in each block starting from block 1. Based on the decision of [KGP-3] in October 2022, 6.4 KLAY have been issued for each block starting from November 13, 2022 (#106444801). As for the KLAY burn volume, a portion of the genesis reserve was burned based on [KGP-6] of April 16, 2023, and a portion of circulating supply was burned based on the transaction fee Make this page better \n\n\nburning and buyback burning. As a result, the estimated total supply is 5,971M KLAY at the time of integration, as of June 27, 2024. \n\n**KLAY Private Sale** \n\nKLAY did not conduct an ICO after issuance and only conducted private sales for institutional investors. \n\nThe private sales were divided into ER (Early Round) and PR (Private Round) from 2018 to 2019. The quantity sold through the private sales was 1,624,251,988 KLAY. The funds were used as operating funds for the mainnet development and operation, and ecosystem expansion. Approximately 1.62 billion KLAY sold through private sales were all unlocked in March 2021 after a step-by-step vesting period, and are already included in the circulating supply. \n\n**KLAY Circulating Supply** \n\nThe circulating supply of a cryptocurrency is the total currently tradable supply of the total issued volume of a specific existing cryptocurrency. In other words, it is the amount that is actually traded and distributed in the market. As of June 27, 2024, the expected integration date, the estimated total supply of Klaytn Blockchain will be 5,971M KLAY, excluding the not yet distributed Klaytn Community Fund \n\n(KCF)^4 of 153M KLAY, Klaytn Foundation Fund (KFF)^5 of 29M KLAY, and KLAY Value Creation Fund (KVCF)^6 of 2,000M KLAY. These numbers are current estimates and may vary slightly due to block generation status, inflation, and governance proposal approvals. Considering that KVCF requires separate approval from the GC, the circulating supply increases when the execution of KCF or KFF is decided and executed. On the other hand, the circulating supply decreases when it is burned due to transaction fees or buybacks. Accordingly, as of June 27, 2024, the total issued supply is 5,971M KLAY while the circulating supply is 3,789M KLAY. There are no plans to use the KVCF until the time of the merger. The KLAY circulating supply will be inherited by the initial circulating supply of KAIA after the chain and token merger. \n\n### FNSA Issuance/Distribution Status \n\n**FNSA Issuance and Burning Volume** \n\nFNSA of Finschia has been automatically issued in each block at an inflation rate of 15% per year on the current total supply according to the Issuance mechanism of the protocol. Initial total supply was 6,734,458 FNSA. The FNSA issued is distributed to the Network Contribution Reward, Service Contribution Reward, and Reserve at a corresponding ratio of 5:3:2 according to the distribution mechanism. No volume of FNSA was burned. As of June 24 2024, the expected integration date, the estimated total number of FNSA issued through inflation is 7.967M FNSA. \n\n**FNSA Private Sale** \n\nFNSA did not conduct private sales. \n\n**FNSA Circulating Supply** Make this page better \n\n\nThe total supply and circulating supply of FNSA are equal. In other words, there is no separate uncirculated volume. Additionally, FNSA will set the inflation to 0% and stop new issuance after prior notice before the integration to ensure smooth integration with KLAY. As of June 24 2024, the expected integration date, the estimated total number of FNSA issued through inflation is 7.967M FNSA. The final confirmed total supply of FNSA will be included in the initial distribution of KAIA and inherited according to the agreed-upon exchange ratio. \n\n**KAIA Issuance/Distribution Plan** \n\nThe KAIA token is created by combining the existing KLAY tokens and FNSA tokens at the time of integration. There may be slight changes in the circulating supply of KLAY and FNSA tokens before the integration through the inflation and burning of block rewards. The circulating supply of the existing KLAY and FNSA at the time of integration will be included in the KAIA circulating supply according to the corresponding exchange rate. Details will be guided through a separate post-announcement by the foundation. The exchange rate for each token to KAIA is as follows: \n\n KLAY: KAIA = 1:1 \n\n FNSA: KAIA = 148.079656:1 \n\nThe estimated circulating supply at the time of integration and KAIA circulating supply can be explained separately as follows: \n\n**Estimated Supply of KLAY and FNSA** \n\n Estimated Circulating Supply^7 KLAY: 3,789M KLAY FNSA: 7.967M FNSA Estimated Uncirculated Volume Klaytn Value Creation Fund (KVCF): 2,000M KLAY Klaytn Community Fund (KCF): 153M KLAY Klaytn Foundation Fund (KFF): 29M KLAY \n\n**Estimated KAIA Issuance Volume** \n\n (+) Conversion of circulating supply (4,968M KAIA) Converted KLAY circulating supply: 3,789M * 1 = 3,789M KAIA Converted FNSA circulating supply: 7.967M * 148.079656 FNSA = 1,179M KAIA (-) Burning of uncirculated volume KVCF + KCF + KFF = 2,182M KAIA = Burn 1,382M KAIA out of 2,182M KAIA (+) Conversion^8 of uncirculated volume remaining after burning into circulating supply LINE NEXT Delegation: 330M KAIA \n\nKaia Ecosystem Fund: 270M KAIA (^) Make this page better \n\n\n Kaia Infrastructure Fund: 200M KAIA \n\nSince the entire uncirculated amount gets burned at the time of KAIA conversion, the total supply and the circulating supply match. The estimated circulating supply at this time of integration is about 5,768M KAIA. \n\nHowever, the mentioned numbers are based on the issuance and circulating supply estimation as of May 14, 2024, GST, and the final figures may change depending on the inflation of Klaytn and Finschia. \n\nThe circulating supply after the token merge may increase according to the measures mentioned in Kaia Blockchain Fund or decrease due to burning. However, as specified in the relevant section, any additional supply must be announced in advance or approved by governance. \n\n**Treasury Rebalance Plan** \n\nWith the launch of the Kaia Blockchain, the new tokenomics mentioned in the Tokenomics section will be applied. This involves a massive scale of tokens, including the conversion of existing FNSA and KLAY circulations to KAIA, new fund allocations, and burned tokens. A treasury rebalance event will occur only once at the launch, which is a critical process that must be systematic, transparent, and auditable. To ensure this, all procedures will be meticulously recorded in smart contracts. Moreover, given the large volume of tokens involved, it is vital to apply various technologies to prevent errors (such as fat finger errors) and minimize security risks. The application of the new tokenomics is structured to proceed safely only after several conditions are met. Ultimately, the new tokenomic state is achieved through the consensus of validators, relying on the highest level of security available on the blockchain. \n\nThe overall process is as follows. A contract named TreasuryRebalance is deployed, followed by the uploading of a rebalance configuration into this contract. All stakeholders whose balance will be altered must approve of the configuration. Once all stakeholders have approved, block validators check the validity of the contract at the hardfork block at which the rebalance event takes place. Provided all conditions are met, block validators execute the rebalance event and reach a consensus. After the event was successful, an execution receipt which block providers output will be uploaded to the contract so that anyone can view the rebalance result. \n\nTreasuryRebalance contract is implemented as a finite state machine and has the following states: \n\n Initialized: right after the deployment. In this state, a list of addresses whose balance will be zeroed, namely “Zeroed”, and addresses whose balance will be allocated, namely “Allocated”, can be registered. \n\n Registered: after all Zeroed and Allocated has been registered. In this state, there cannot be further registration. All owners of Zeroed must send a consent transaction, which indicates that they approve that their balance will be burnt. \n\n Approved: after all consents have been collected, the contract can enter Approved state. Any change in this contract is prohibited until the hardfork block passes. \n\n Make this page better \n\n\n Finalized: After the hardfork block, the rebalance result, namely “memo”, is recorded and the contract is finalized. The contract is rendered immutable. \n\nThe state transition is only possible in the following order. However, there can be a “reset” where all data is deleted and the state goes back to initialized. \n\nAll block validators validate the contract state at the hardfork block. The rebalance event takes place only in the Approved state where no further change can happen. Since this event depends on the consensus of all validators, it is ensured that all validators reach the same world state after this event. \n\nAll block validators produce the result of the rebalance event called memo in their validator log. The memo is uploaded to the TreasuryRebalance contract during Finalize. memory is a JSON-formatted string which contains information such as the balance of Zeroed before the rebalance, the balance of Allocated after the rebalance, and the burnt amount. The admin of treasury rebalance validates the consistency of the memo and uploads it to TreasuryRebalance contract. After finalization, the contract becomes immutable forever. \n\n## Governance \n\n### Governance Core Components \n\nKaia Governance operates based on three main components: Kaia Community, Kaia Council, and Kaia Foundation. Kaia Community encompasses all KAIA holders, who have the right to express their opinions on Kaia Mainnet operations via the governance forum and social channel. Kaia Council represents the community and directly participates in the governance decisions of the project based on the coins it holds and voting rights delegated from the community. Lastly, Kaia Foundation utilizes its expertise in blockchain and Web3 technology to provide evidence, based on professional knowledge and data that could assist Kaia Council in making decisions and implementing the decisions made through governance. Kaia Governance ensures effective decision-making and execution with this systematic structure and pursues transparent and fair community operation. \n\n### Governance System \n\nKaia Governance respects the diversity of the governance system and seeks to create a diverse governance ecosystem through the coexistence, cooperation, and competition of multiple systems. It encompasses various forms of governance found in the real world ranging from representative democracy, where each individual grants voting rights to decision-makers to representatives, the DAO system, where all members participate in the decision-making process of the organization, and capitalism, where shareholders influence company decisions through representatives designated by^ Make^ this^ page^ better \n\n\nshareholders. Kaia Governance seeks to lay the foundation for a transparent and fair blockchain ecosystem through this comprehensive approach. Its vision is to build a stronger and more flexible system by combining the strengths of multiple governance models. \n\n### Community-Centered Governance \n\nAt Kaia, organizations based on various governance systems will participate in governance, express their opinions, and thereby prove the excellence of their systems. More holders and assets will be concentrated in systems that have proven their greater contribution to the sustainable development of the Kaia ecosystem, resulting in more decision-making authority being concentrated in members with successful systems. Also, the council members will replicate successful governance, expanding the system. \n\nAs time passes, optimized governance systems for new trends will emerge. Kaia Governance will continue to develop focusing on the optimized governance system in line with these changes, which will contribute to an increased efficiency of the entire ecosystem. In the process, Kaia will present an example of a governance system with both diversity and flexibility and will lead the innovation in governance in the blockchain ecosystem. \n\nKaia builds the Kaia Governance system based on the belief that Web3 innovation has its roots in the participation of various communities. In line with this hypothesis, greater importance is given to community input in the decision-making process. As a result, it ensures that decision-making power is fairly distributed among different council members. Through this approach, Kaia Governance aims to foster sustainable development and innovation in Web3 by prioritizing the voices of the community and creating a more inclusive and diverse decision-making environment. \n\n### Governance Direction \n\nKaia Governance adopts a strategy of adjusting the pace of the governance process, considering changes in the cryptocurrency market and the development stage of the Kaia ecosystem. The discussion and processing speed of the agenda are determined through a consensus between the foundation, council, and community, which reflects the rapidly changing cryptocurrency market situation and the ongoing growth process of Project Kaia. Currently, in 2024, the ecosystem of Project Kaia is still in the development stage despite the rapid progress over the past five years, and Kaia takes a governance approach with growth as its priority. By establishing a structure where the agendas can be discussed and decided quickly, the project plans to proactively respond to the changing market environments and accelerate the growth of the ecosystem. \n\n## Technology \n\n### Overview Make this page better \n\n\nKaia Blockchain has three primary technical objectives. \n\nFirst, performance is paramount. The blockchain emphasizes rapid finality, ensuring that users receive immediate responses. It also aims to process a high volume of user requests quickly, enabling blockchain applications (dApps) on Kaia Blockchain to offer a user experience comparable to conventional mobile apps. \n\nSecond, transparency is crucial. Decision-making at the layer 1 protocol has widespread implications across the ecosystem. Therefore, decisions should be made transparently through on-chain governance. Furthermore, Kaia Blockchain intends to publicly disclose all elements related to the operation of the blockchain network, ensuring that it is fully verifiable by anyone. \n\nThird, sustainability is essential. Operating a blockchain over the long term presents various challenges, such as the continuous increase in block data and the economics necessary to sustain network operations. Kaia Blockchain is designed to reduce operational costs and increase profitability, ensuring its long-term viability. \n\nThe forthcoming content will cover two main topics. The first is the genesis of the Kaia Blockchain, describing the technologies applied, including consensus mechanisms, smart contracts, and on-chain governance, which collectively reflect the extensive technical considerations made to achieve its goals. The second topic is the evolution of the Kaia Blockchain. It will introduce a variety of new technologies that are planned for the near future, including maintaining high performance while allowing anyone to operate a validator node in a permissionless manner, enhancing transparency in block transaction ordering to mitigate the negative effects of Maximal Extractable Value (MEV), and block archiving techniques for swift verification of historical blocks. These innovations will set the Kaia Blockchain apart, enhancing its uniqueness and attractiveness. \n\n### Birth of Kaia Blockchain \n\nTo achieve the aforementioned technical goal, Kaia Blockchain is launched with various technical features. Specifically, the performance goal is facilitated by consensus and network topology, and the transparency and the sustainability is facilitated by smart contracts and on-chain governance. The initial performance of Kaia Blockchain is as follows: \n\n Process 4,000 transactions/sec (TPS) \n\n Instant transaction finality \n\n Creation time of 1 block/second \n\n**Consensus and Networking** \n\nBlockchains use a “distributed ledger,” which consists of a connected network between individuals with several network participants to record and manage the transaction information. Each blockchain adoptsMake this page better \n\n\na consensus algorithm that is most suitable for it, with the aim of efficient and smooth consensus on transaction validation and block generation among network participants. These consensus algorithms help the system to reach a consensus on the correct state, even if there is a system failure or malicious attack on the network. They play an important role in ensuring the integrity and stability of the blockchain. \n\n**IBFT (Istanbul Byzantine Fault Tolerance)** \n\nKaia aims to become an enterprise-support and service-oriented platform. Therefore, the finality problem must be solved, with the network allowing many nodes to participate in the network. For this purpose, Kaia uses an optimized version of Istanbul BFT, which implements PBFT with modifications to suit the characteristics of blockchain networks. \n\nKaia Blockchain has three types of nodes: Consensus Node(CN), Proxy Nodes(PN), and Endpoint Nodes (EN). CN is managed by a validator and is responsible for block creation. These blocks are verified by all the nodes within the network. \n\nKaia Blockchain has adopted and enhanced Istanbul BFT to achieve rapid finality. Since validation and consensus occur with each block, there are no forks, and the finality of the blocks where consensus is reached is immediately guaranteed. Block proposers are selected in an unpredictable manner using aMake this page better \n\n\nVerifiable Random Function (VRF), thereby offering high resistance to centralized Denial of Service (DoS) attacks. CN must deposit a certain amount of tokens, maintaining reasonable networking costs while enabling easy operation by any EN, thus enhancing the scalability of the blockchain network usage. \n\n**Multi-channel Broadcast** \n\nNetwork latency is greatly affected by network congestion. Assuming the throughput of the network is constant, network latency increases proportionally to the increase in the number of transactions. General users of mobile apps or web services do not tolerate response times longer than a few seconds, and there is no reason to assume that blockchain services will have greater user patience. \n\nKaia Blockchain adopts a multi-channel approach to deal with network congestion. By allocating separate propagation channels to transactions and blocks, the Kaia network can propagate newly created blocks in a timely manner even when the network faces severe congestion due to a large number of transactions. In turn, Kaia guarantees the dApps on the network to continue responding to end-user requests despite intermittent network traffic surges. \n\n**Consensus Process** \n\nThe consensus process consists of the following three stages: \n\n1. Election: The Committee is composed of Consensus Nodes (CNs) that participate in achieving     consensus. This is a similar task to the leader election in a general distributed system. The proposer     is randomly selected through VRF since knowing them in advance can make them vulnerable to     targeted DoS (denial of service). \n\n2. Block Generation: Elected proposers create a block and make a proposal to the committee. The     block proposal made through the P2P network is sent to the committee. \n\n3. Block Verification: The committee verifies and signs the block proposed by the proposer. A block is     complete when more than a quorum of signatures is collected. \n\n**Account Model and Smart Contract** \n\nKaia Blockchain offers scalability in service development through its expanded account model and smart contract capabilities. Smart contracts on the blockchain enhance the efficiency of transactions and contracts between individuals through contract automation, and the use of smart contracts has had a significant impact on the blockchain and dApp ecosystem. Contract conditions can be coded into smart contracts and automatically executed, solving the trusted intermediary issue. Smart contracts have allowed the blockchain ecosystem to create new business models and economic systems by reducing the cost and time required to complete transactions. Kaia Blockchain supports a distributed virtual machine for executing smart contracts, which is designed to be fast and efficient, providing the best and swiftest development environment for dApp developers and projects. Make this page better \n\n\n**Account Model** \n\nThe Kaia Blockchain supports an expanded form of the Account Model. Inside the implementation of an EOA (Externally Owned Account) account, it is possible to store an Account Key, which is an expanded form of the EOA’s Public Key. This information allows users to replace the Private Key associated with that account. Additionally, users can register multiple Private Keys for use in Multi-Signature setups or to separate roles among different Private Key users. The roles provided include the authority to create transactions, update registered keys in the Account, and permissions solely for fee delegation purposes. \n\n**Kaia Virtual Machine (KVM)** \n\nThe current version of Kaia Virtual Machine (KVM) is a derivative of the Ethereum Virtual Machine (EVM). It supports all Opcodes of the Ethereum Virtual Machine equally while providing additional precompiled contracts unique to the Kaia Virtual Machine. To prevent the additional precompiled contracts of Kaia from colliding with the precompiled contracts of the Ethereum Virtual Machine, the precompiled contract addresses of Kaia are given in a decreasing order starting from 0x03ff. \n\nKaia Virtual Machine provides several methods to write and run Smart Contracts on the Kaia network. Kaia supports Solidity and maintains interoperability with Ethereum development toolkits such as Remix, Hardhat, Truffle, and Foundry. A smart contract written with Solidity can be compiled using the existing Solidity compiler and can be run on Kaia without additional work. Solidity is the de facto standard contract programming language on Ethereum and is supported by an active community. Therefore, Kaia Blockchain supports the Solidity language to provide the most familiar development environment for Ethereum dApp developers allowing them to easily migrate their work. \n\n**System contracts** \n\nKaia Blockchain manages a part of protocol as smart contracts, which are called system contracts. Block validators directly or indirectly interact with system contracts. System contracts facilitate transparent and easy-to-access protocol operation. There is a specification that defines a Registry contract which will contain new system contracts. It can be viewed by a REST API and thus users can continuously check and monitor system contracts. \n\nSince system contracts can directly impact the blockchain protocol, they need to be managed in a highly secure manner. They are internally classified as the highest level of security, and thus they are managed as a multi-sig by default. Storing of keys and signing of transactions are performed in an isolated device which is never connected to online. In addition, there are internal manuals and tools for systematic management of system contracts. \n\nThese are essential system contracts: \n\n AddressBook: a contract which manages a list of validators. \n\n GovParam: a contract for on-chain governance on network parameters. Make^ this^ page^ better \n\n\n SimpleBlsRegistry: a BLS key storage for validators. \n\n**On-Chain Governance** \n\nOn-chain governance is an on-chain decision-making system among stakeholders. On-chain governance is implemented in a structure including smart contracts and has several advantages over off-chain governance. The entire process of governance is transparently recorded, and anyone can check the progress of governance on-chain (transparency). Since the governance process proceeds solely according to the contract logic, the voting and results cannot be tampered with maliciously (integrity). Therefore, the intentions of the participants can be reflected without any distortion in the governance process. Also, it is impossible to deny a vote because no one except the voter can vote (non-repudiation). As a result, the voters become accountable for their voting behaviors. An environment where the voting results can be enforced compulsorily or automatically can be created (enforceability). Without enforceability, the implementer may ignore the voting results, which will eventually reduce the credibility of governance. \n\nKaia Blockchain implements an on-chain governance system satisfying the above properties. The onchain governance of Kaia Blockchain is designed to be fair and to ensure diverse opinions are shared. Voting entities can vote on all agenda items. Voting rights are calculated in proportion to the amount of staking. However, there is a cap on voting rights to prevent minority opinions from being ignored. Users can delegate their staking amount to other voters. \n\nThe voting process is transparent and open. Types of agendas include text agendas, parameter change agendas, and fund expense agendas. For some agendas, such as parameter change agendas, a transaction can be attached to the agenda. In this case, once the agenda is passed, the transaction will be automatically executed. This allows the mandatory performance of governance by automatically reflecting the changes in network parameters as well as executing funds through governance. \n\nOther than this, various detailed policy decisions, such as restrictions on voting rights, voting periods, and voter participation, are needed for a comprehensive and fair decision-making system. A highly reliable network will be built by establishing a governance system that harmoniously reflects the needs and expectations of various stakeholders. \n\n**Governance Process** \n\nThe overall governance process of Kaia is as follows: \n\n1. Discussion: Improve the agenda through free discussion among all participants off-chain. \n\n2. On-Chain Agenda Voting: Register the agenda on-chain and proceed with voting. \n\n3. Reflect Results (Activation): Implement when agenda items are approved. \n\n Make this page better \n\n\nAgendas registered on-chain go through several states until the voting is complete. \n\n Pending: Status after the agenda is registered and until voting takes place. As the agenda is registered, the list of voters is determined. \n\n Active: Voting is in progress. The voting power of the voters gets fixed when voting begins. \n\n Passed: Agenda passed with the approval of a quorum. \n\n Failed: Agenda rejected because it did not receive a quorum of approval votes. \n\n Queued: Waiting period after the passing of the agenda and before the execution. \n\n Executed: Agenda fully executed. \n\n**Enforceability** \n\nKaia Blockchain is configurable via several network parameters, with which they can be altered by onchain governance. An example of network parameters is “upperboundbasefee”, which defines the maximum value to which the dynamic gas fee can go up. There exists a system contract named GovParam, which enables the enforceability of the governance proposal. This contract is a key-value storage with an activation number for each key. A value of network parameter can be updated by submitting a tuple of (param as a key, new value, activation block number), which will be read by validators and be activated starting from the activation block. \n\n Make this page better \n\n\nThe above figure shows how network parameters are updated via on-chain governance. A governance proposal can contain a transaction, which will be executed once the proposal passes. When proposing, the proposer attaches a transaction which invokes GovParam. When the proposal passes, the secretary sends a transaction to execute the proposal, which will internally invoke the transaction contained in the proposal. Validators check GovParam every block and apply the new network parameter value at the activation block. In this way, the network parameters can be enforced in a decentralized manner. \n\n### Kaia Evolution \n\nThe Kaia Blockchain is committed to continuously adopting new technologies to achieve the three technical objectives introduced earlier. Some of these technologies are expected to be developed and implemented in the near future. Specifically, new technologies that Kaia blockchain will adopt can improve the aforementioned three goals; high performance permissionless allows anyone to become a node validator, mitigating the negative effect of MEV with transparent tx ordering, archiving old blocks in a verifiable manner, and public governance delegation can facilitate high performance, transparency, and sustainability. \n\n**High-Performance Permissionless** \n\nBFT-type consensus algorithms generally have restrictions in the process of participating as a validator. This is due to the tendency of the performance of the entire network to deteriorate caused by abnormal nodes when validators participate freely. As an integrated chain, Kaia pursues a completely permissionless network and will develop into a network where anyone can participate as a block creation node while maintaining high performance. After introducing the Permissionless Network, nodes meeting certain conditions will be given the role of block creation nodes. Specifically, an automated qualification verification process will be introduced to check whether the block creation node is qualified to maintain stability. In terms of consensus participating in the creation and verification of blocks, there areMake this page better \n\n\n“candidates” and validators. In terms of governance, there are Governance Council Members. One can register as a candidate and meet specific conditions to become a validator. Validators can receive rewards by participating in the block creation consensus process. Permissionless Network is implemented through the following factors: \n\n Unpredictable Proposer Selection Algorithm: An algorithm that strengthens resistance to DoS attacks by changing the block proposer selection method difficult to predict. \n\n VRank (Validator Reputation Evaluation Framework): A framework that evaluates the reputation of a validator. \n\n Autonomous Validator Slashing System: A system that penalizes erroneous or malicious actions of validators. \n\n System Transaction and Consensus Msg: A reflection of the latest consensus information in the contract for each block through a “system transaction” automatically generated by the block proposer. \n\n**Maximal Extraction Value** \n\nMEV (Maximal Extractable Value) is the potential benefit that can be gained by strategically ordering or changing the transaction order in a block. MEV involves unfair practices, such as front-running, to gain profits at the expense of other users. Kaia Network aims to build a system that ensures a fair and transparent transaction order to mitigate the negative effects of MEV. Also, a method to redistribute or burn MEV extraction profits into the network ecosystem will be provided to support the sustainable development of the network. Lastly, a system to monitor and share transactions in real time will be implemented to prevent any unfair practices that may be carried out by validators, increasing the reliability of the network. This will not only increase the transparency and fairness of the Kaia network but will also greatly contribute to the sustainable development of the ecosystem. \n\n**Block Data Archiving** \n\nBlockchain continuously has an increase in the blocks (data) stored over time due to transaction history and execution of smart contracts. The capacity of Kaia Blockchain is growing even faster due to its short block time and high transaction throughput (TPS). As a result, the cost of new validators participating in the network and verifying the blocks by synchronizing them is also increasing. The volume of data accumulated over the years is not small, and it takes a lot of resources to verify it. High verification costs work as a barrier for new validators to enter, which can reduce the reliability of the chain. To solve this issue, Kaia Blockchain will study how to reduce the verification cost of past blocks. The following methods will be considered and introduced as they compress or archive old blocks in a verifiable manner so that only the archived data can be quickly verified without each block having to be verified. \n\n Verifiable block data compression: Compresses blocks in a verifiable manner. \n\n Block data pruning at a certain block cycle or data unit \n\n Make this page better \n\n\n Convert the blocks pruned in on-chain into a verifiable certificate and record in on-chain. This certificate is compressed and recorded as a Commitment using cryptography (such as KZG) or Proof using the recursion method of ZKP. \n\n Support a verification system that can verify certificates in on-chain \n\n Verification system efficiently and constantly verifies certificates. \n\n At the time of compression, the certificate is verified and recorded in the block when the next block is created. \n\n Anyone can verify the corresponding certificate through a verification system. \n\n Lightweight block synchronization: When participating as a new node or verifier, synchronize and verify the compressed certificates and subsequent blocks rather than synchronize the entire block data. \n\n Support DA Layer: Some users and dApps require a checkup on historical data. A DA Layer is provided to provide trusted data without faults. \n\nBy dramatically reducing the verification cost by the above methods, new validators will be able to onboard quickly. \n\n**Public Delegation** \n\nKaia Blockchain provides a function where validator operators can be delegated. To provide this function as a default, Kaia Blockchain will additionally develop and provide a contract providing a public delegation function in conjunction with staking contracts for validators. This will allow users to participate in governance in the future by expanding the voting power of voters by delegating tokens to other voters expressing opinions on their behalf. This structure is similar to representative democracy, a form of politics in which the people elect members of the National Assembly, and the members of the National Assembly vote when the National Assembly passes an agenda. The users, furthermore, can delegate or revoke their delegation whenever they wish in Kaia Blockchain. This will allow general holders to reflect their opinions in governance and a governance system respecting diverse opinions will be established. \n\n## Roadmap \n\nKaia Blockchain is an integrated mainnet platform that started with the integration of the Finschia Foundation and the Klaytn Foundation. Its core goal is to provide an infrastructure for the adoption of Web3. To achieve this goal, Kaia Blockchain seeks to facilitate the development of blockchain-based projects through builder-centric support. Through this, new potentials of Web3 technology will be explored. Kaia Blockchain provides developers with essential toolkits, SDKs, and IDEs to help them easily implement innovative and competitive solutions at all stages of project development. Make this page better \n\n\nIn addition, strategies such as messenger integration through cooperation with Kakao and LINE will help Web2 users easily transfer to Web3. This approach will accelerate the adoption of Web3 technology and allow more users to experience the benefits of blockchain technology. Kaia Blockchain will foster the growth of a strong developer community and explore new possibilities in blockchain technology by enabling access to various infrastructure assets and KAIA funds while also supporting decentralized governance and permissionless participation. \n\nThe roadmap of the integrated mainnet focuses on supporting developers and driving Web3 adoption at the same time. This will enable Kaia Blockchain to help both developers and general users build successful projects, adopt blockchain technology more broadly, and establish a solid foundation to explore the new possibilities of the Web3 world. \n\n### Short-term Initiatives \n\n#### 2024 Q1 \n\n Construction and operation of the Klaytn & Finschia integrated TF \n\n**2024 Q2** \n\n Establishment of a new integrated chain brand Establishment of a joint marketing system and community integration Preparation for ecosystem infrastructure, DApp, and service migration (~Q4) Network support for integration and response to existing DApps and services (~Q4) Preparation for new integrated tokens issuance and swap service provision Establishment of the 1st integrated network (EVM) \n\n**2024 Q3** \n\n Issuance of new integrated tokens and provision of swap services Strengthening of the node user/community delegation function Introduction of a new burning model (~Q4) \n\n**2024 Q4** \n\n Reorganization of the integrated foundation and promotion of joint business initiatives Establishment of the 2nd integrated network \n\n### Long-term Initiatives \n\n**Establishment of infrastructure for institutional needs** \n\nEstablishment of integrated token, Fiat On/Off Ramp, for major Asian countries (^) Make this page better \n\n\n Establishment of infrastructure for improved accessibility by institutional investors \n\n**Strengthening of large-scale DeFi infrastructure** \n\n Establishment of a new De-fi ecosystem for the integrated mainnet Expansion of RWA (Real World Asset) linked services \n\n**Launching of native stablecoins** \n\n Launching of key stable coins based on the integrated mainnet Expansion of native stable coin-based services \n\n**Asian community boost-up** \n\n Re-establishment of developer and user communities in each Asian country Expansion of governance and ecosystem partners in major countries \n\n**Discovery of AI DApp categories** \n\n Establishment of new AI DApp categories and activation of onboarding Discovery of generative AI-based content/avatar/game Dapps \n\n**Large-scale on-chain tokenization of Web2 assets** \n\n Linking of Web2 digital items, memberships, and ticket markets Discovery of large-scale item tokenization and mass adoption cases \n\n**Onboarding of Asian SSS game companies** \n\n Interoperable game onboarding based on Brown Friends IP Web3 game onboarding based on Japanese SSS-rated game company IP \n\n**Cooperation in Global IP projects** \n\n Web3 project onboarding of large global IP companies Strengthening of onboarding infrastructure for Web2 companies \n\n## Important Notes \n\n### Disclaimer of liability \n\nTo the maximum extent permitted by the applicable laws, regulations and rules, the Kaia Foundation shall not be liable for any indirect, special, incidental, consequential or other losses of any kind, in tort, contract or otherwise (including but not limited to loss of revenue, income or profits, and loss of use or^ Make^ this^ page^ better \n\n\ndata), arising out of or in connection with any acceptance of or reliance on this Whitepaper or any part thereof by you. \n\n### No representations and warranties \n\nThe Kaia Foundation does not make or purport to make, and hereby disclaims, any representation, warranty or undertaking in any form whatsoever to any entity or person, including any representation, warranty or undertaking in relation to the truth, accuracy and completeness of any of the information set out in this Whitepaper. \n\nNothing contained in this Whitepaper is or may be relied upon as a promise, representation or undertaking as to the future performance or policies of the Kaia Foundation.

    " Smart Contracts Kaia Compatible Tokens (KCTs) \n\n# Kaia Compatible Tokens (KCTs) \n\n### Kaia Compatible Token (KCT) is a special type of smart contract that implements certain technical \n\n### specifications. Everyone who wants to issue tokens on top of Kaia must follow the specification. \n\n### Token standards are defined in Kaia such as KIP-7 and KIP-17. \n\n### Other KCTs can be defined to meet certain technical specifications. If anyone needs other token \n\n### standards, please visit Kaia Improvement Proposal and propose a new token standard. \n\n## Fungible Token Standard (KIP-7) \n\n### Fungible tokens are tokens that have properties of uniformity and divisibility. Every fungible token is \n\n### interchangeable as each unit of token possesses the same value. Just like every dollar bill has the same \n\n### value of one dollar. Since fungibility is essential feature to crypto currency in most cases, large \n\n### proportion of blockchain tokens are fungible tokens. \n\n### To implement these properties with smart contracts, KIP-7 token standard can be used. KIP-7\n\n### compatible tokens implement the following interface. Please note that KIP-13 must be implemented \n\n### together. For wallet applications, wallet interface can be implemented. \n\n#### // IKIP7 \n\n event Transfer ( address indexed from , address indexed to , uint256 value ); event Approval ( address indexed owner , address indexed spender , uint256 value ); \n\n function totalSupply() external view returns ( uint256 ); function balanceOf( address account ) external view returns ( uint256 ); function transfer( address recipient , uint256 amount ) external returns ( bool ); function allowance( address owner , address spender ) external view returns ( uint256 ); function approve( address spender , uint256 amount ) external returns ( bool ); function transferFrom( address sender , address recipient , uint256 amount ) external returns function safeTransfer( address recipient , uint256 amount , bytes data ) external; function safeTransfer( address recipient , uint256 amount ) external; function safeTransferFrom( address sender , address recipient , uint256 amount , bytes data ) function safeTransferFrom( address sender , address recipient , uint256 amount ) external; \n\n // IKIP7Metadata (optional) function name() external view returns ( string memory); function symbol() external view returns ( string memory); function decimals() external view returns ( uint8 ); \n\n // IKIP7Mintable (optional) function mint( address _to , uint256 _amount ) external returns ( bool ); function isMinter( address _account ) external view returns ( bool ); function addMinter( address _account ) external; \n\n Make this page better \n\n\n### Based on the interface above, developers may customize tokens by adding new features and logics, and \n\n### deploy them on Kaia network. \n\n### For more information, refer to the official KIP-7 documentation. \n\n### An example implementation is available at https://github.com/kaiachain/kaia\n\n### contracts/blob/main/contracts/KIP/token/KIP7/KIP7.sol. \n\n## Non-fungible Token Standard (KIP-17) \n\n### Non-fungible token (NFT) is a special type of token that represents a unique asset. As the name non\n\n### fungible implies, every single token is unique and non-divisible. This uniqueness of non-fungible token \n\n### opens up new horizons of asset digitization. For example, it can be used to represent digital art, game \n\n### items, or any kind of unique assets and allow people to trade them. \n\n### For example, a blockchain collection game Cryptokitties implements non-fungible token to represent \n\n### different kitties that have different genetic information. Every kitty is unique and non-interchangeable, \n\n### resulting in different values for different kitty tokens. \n\n### To implement non-fungible token, KIP-17 can be used. KIP-17 token contracts implement the following \n\n### interface. Please note that KIP-13 must be implemented together.

    " Tools Kaia Contracts Wizard \n\n# Kaia Contracts Wizard \n\n## Introduction \n\n#### Kaia prioritizes providing a seamless developer experience, which is the driving force behind the \n\n#### creation of the Kaia Contracts Wizard (KCW). KCW serves as an interactive tool for effortlessly \n\n#### bootstrapping your smart contracts and utilizing the secure, tested components available in Kaia \n\n#### Contracts. In essence, it simplifies the process of developing smart contracts by leveraging the \n\n#### components of Kaia contracts. It’s worth noting that the Kaia contracts wizard is built on the foundation \n\n#### of the OpenZeppelin Wizard, further bolstering the security of smart contract development. \n\n#### In this guide you will: \n\n#### Understand the basic functionality of Kaia Contracts Wizard. \n\n#### Generate and customize smart contract code using Kaia Contracts Wizard. \n\n#### Deploy Kaia contracts to the Kaia Network (Kairos) using Foundry Scripting System. \n\n## Exploring Kaia Contracts Wizard \n\n#### Kaia Contracts Wizard posits itself as the fastest and easiest way to write your smart contract using \n\n#### Kaia Contracts. In this section, we will dive into the various components and segments of the Kaia \n\n#### Contract Wizard. \n\n#### As it is, the Kaia contracts wizard supports the following token standards: \n\n#### KIP-7 — This is a fungible token standard for Kaia. Fungible means that all tokens are divisible and \n\n#### interchangeable, that is, have the same value. One typical example of fungible tokens is fiatMake this page better \n\n\n#### currencies, where each equal-denomination bill has the same value. \n\n#### KIP-17 — This is a non-fungible token standard for Kaia. Non-fungible means that each token is \n\n#### indivisible, and therefore, unique. A KIP17 token can represent ownership of a unique item, whether \n\n#### physical property or virtual collectibles — like a picture, item in a game, real estate, and so on. \n\n#### KIP-37 — This is known as the multi-token standard for Kaia, because it can represent both fungible \n\n#### and non-fungible tokens in a single smart contract. \n\n#### In line with our Ethereum Equivalence support, Kaia contracts wizard also supports ERC20, ERC721, \n\n#### ERC1155. \n\n#### Kaia Contracts Wizard is comprised of the following sections: \n\n#### Token standard section : This tab comprises all the different token standards supported by the Kaia \n\n#### contracts wizard. \n\n#### Settings section : This section provides the preliminary settings for each token standard, such as \n\n#### token name, symbol, pre-mint (token supply when the contract is deployed), and URI (for non\n\n#### fungible tokens). \n\n#### Features section : comprises all features available for each token standard. You can find more \n\n#### information about the different extensions available for each tokens in the following links: \n\n#### KIP7 \n\n#### KIP17 \n\n#### KIP37 \n\n#### Access Control section : comprises all the available access control mechanisms for each token \n\n#### standard. \n\n#### Interactive code display section : this displays the smart contract code generated with the \n\n#### configuration as set by the user. \n\n Make this page better \n\n\n#### Having explored the different parts of the Kaia contracts wizard, you can now select the kind of contract \n\n#### that you want (current support for KIP7 , KIP17 , KIP37 , ERC20 , ERC721 , ERC1155 , Governor , and custom \n\n#### contracts), set your parameters and desired features (token name, symbol, pre-mint amount, access \n\n#### control, etc.), and Contracts Wizard will generate all of the code necessary. The generated code is thus \n\n#### ready to be compiled and deployed, or it can serve as a starting point and customized further with \n\n#### application specific logic. \n\n## Customizing and Deploying Kaia Contracts on Kaia \n\n## Network \n\n#### In this section, you will deploy the generated code from kaia contracts wizard to the Kaia Testnet Kairos \n\n#### using Foundry. The generated code will serve as a starting point and customized further to fit an airdrop \n\n#### contract for KIP7 and KIP17 tokens. While on the other end the generated code for KIP37 will be used as it \n\n#### is. \n\n#### Let’s get started! \n\n### Prerequisites \n\n#### To follow along in this tutorial, the prerequisites are highlighted below: \n\n#### Make sure to have foundry installed. \n\n#### Clone the klaytn-foundry-starterkit code. \n\n#### MetaMask: used to deploy the contracts, sign transactions and interact with the contracts. \n\n Make this page better \n\n\n#### RPC Endpoint: you can get this from one of the supported endpoint providers. \n\n#### Test KAIA from Faucet: fund your account with sufficient KAIA. \n\n### Getting Started \n\n#### This guide walks you through a simple implementation of an airdrop contract for KIP7 and KIP17 token \n\n#### standard. In the airdrop contract, the creator of the project mints each respective tokens directly to a \n\n#### certain selection of wallets. In the next sections, we will be looking at how to customize and deploy each \n\n#### token airdrop contract respectively. \n\n### Customizing Token contracts \n\n#### Customizing KIP7 contract to KIP7 Airdrop contract. \n\n#### You need to customize your KIP7 contract before modifying it to an airdrop contract. To do that, follow \n\n#### the steps below: \n\n#### 1. Navigate to wizard.klaytn.foundation. \n\n#### 2. On the Contracts tab select KIP7 \n\n#### 3. Next is to fill the name (KIP7 Token Airdrop) and symbol (KTA) in the SETTINGS tab. The pre-mint \n\n#### field is left empty \n\n#### 4. Subsequently on the FEATURES tab, tick the Mintable feature box, it then automatically selects the \n\n#### Ownable feature in ACCESS CONTROL tab. \n\n#### This is how Kaia contracts wizard would look like after making these configurations: \n\n Make this page better \n\n\n#### Here is the generated code: \n\n#### The next thing is to modify the code above to suit our airdrop implementation which looks like this: \n\n // SPDX-License-Identifier: MIT pragma solidity ^0.8.4; import \"@kaiachain/contracts/KIP/token/KIP7/KIP7.sol\"; import \"@kaiachain/contracts/access/Ownable.sol\"; contract KIP7TokenAirdrop is KIP7 , Ownable { constructor() KIP7(\"KIP7 Token Airdrop\", \"KTA\") {} function supportsInterface( bytes4 interfaceId ) public view virtual override returns ( bool ) { return super .supportsInterface(interfaceId); } function mint( address to , uint256 amount ) public onlyOwner { _mint(to, amount); } } \n\n //SPDX-License-Identifier: MIT pragma solidity ^0.8.4; import \"@kaiachain/contracts/KIP/token/KIP7/KIP7.sol\"; import \"@kaiachain/contracts/access/Ownable.sol\"; contract KIP7TokenAirdrop is KIP7 , Ownable { constructor() KIP7(\"KIP7 Token Airdrop\", \"KTA\") { } // airdrop fungible token function airdropTokens( address [] calldata wAddresses , uint [] calldata tAmount ) public require(wAddresses.length == tAmount.length, \"Must be same lenght\"); for ( uint256 i = 0 ; i < wAddresses.length; i++) { _mintSingleTokens(wAddresses[i], tAmount[i]); } } function _mintSingleTokens( address wAddress , uint amount ) private { _mint(wAddress, amount); } function supportsInterface( bytes4 interfaceId ) public view virtual override returns ( bool ) { return super .supportsInterface(interfaceId); } } Make this page better \n\n\nFrom the code modified above, you can see that we added a new function called (^) airdropTokens(). \n\n#### This function mints tokens to certain selected addresses and can only be called by the creator of the \n\n#### contract onlyOwner. \n\n#### Subsequently, we modified the public mint() onlyOwner function to _mintSingleTokens() private. \n\n#### Now that we have our KIP7 airdrop contract code ready, the next step is to create a new file named \n\n#### airdropKIP7.sol in the src folder of your project directory and paste the modified code in the file. \n\n#### Customizing KIP17 contract to KIP17 Airdrop contract. \n\n#### You need to customize your KIP17 contract before modifying it to an airdrop contract. To do that, follow \n\n#### the steps below: \n\n#### 1. Navigate to wizard.klaytn.foundation. \n\n#### 2. On the Contracts tab select KIP17 \n\n#### 3. Next is to fill the name (KIP7 NFT Airdrop) and symbol (KNA) in the SETTINGS tab. The Base URI field \n\n#### is to be left empty. \n\n#### 4. Subsequently on the FEATURES tab, tick the Mintable , Auto-increment Ids , and Enumerable \n\n#### feature box. You will notice that the Ownable feature in ACCESS CONTROL tab has been \n\n#### automatically selected. \n\n#### This is how Kaia contracts wizard would look like after making these configurations: \n\n#### Here is the generated code: \n\n Make this page better \n\n\n#### The next thing is to modify the code above to suit our airdrop implementation which looks like this: \n\n // SPDX-License-Identifier: MIT pragma solidity ^0.8.4; import \"@kaiachain/contracts/KIP/token/KIP17/KIP17.sol\"; import \"@kaiachain/contracts/KIP/token/KIP17/extensions/KIP17Enumerable.sol\"; import \"@kaiachain/contracts/access/Ownable.sol\"; import \"@kaiachain/contracts/utils/Counters.sol\"; contract KIP17NFTAirdrop is KIP17 , KIP17Enumerable , Ownable { using Counters for Counters .Counter; Counters.Counter private _tokenIdCounter; constructor() KIP17(\"KIP17 NFT Airdrop\", \"KNA\") {} function safeMint( address to ) public onlyOwner { uint256 tokenId = _tokenIdCounter.current(); _tokenIdCounter.increment(); _safeMint(to, tokenId); } // The following functions are overrides required by Solidity. function _beforeTokenTransfer( address from , address to , uint256 tokenId ) internal override(KIP17, KIP17Enumerable) { super ._beforeTokenTransfer(from, to, tokenId); } function supportsInterface( bytes4 interfaceId ) public view override(KIP17, KIP17Enumerable) returns ( bool ) { return super .supportsInterface(interfaceId); } } \n\n // SPDX-License-Identifier: MIT pragma solidity ^0.8.4; import \"@kaiachain/contracts/KIP/token/KIP17/KIP17.sol\"; import \"@kaiachain/contracts/KIP/token/KIP17/extensions/KIP17Enumerable.sol\"; import \"@kaiachain/contracts/access/Ownable.sol\"; import \"@kaiachain/contracts/utils/Counters.sol\"; contract KIP17NftAirdrop is KIP17 , KIP17Enumerable , Ownable { using Counters for Counters .Counter; Counters.Counter private _tokenIdCounter; constructor() KIP17(\"KIP17 NFT Airdrop\", \"KNA\") {} // Airdrop NFTs function airdropNfts( address [] calldata wAddresses ) public onlyOwner { require(wAddresses.length != 0 , \"Must no be equal to zero\"); for ( uint256 i = 0 ; i < wAddresses.length; i++) { _mintSingleNFT(wAddresses[i]); } } function _mintSingleNFT( address to ) private { uint256 tokenId = _tokenIdCounter.current(); _tokenIdCounter.increment(); _safeMint(to, tokenId); } Make this page better \n\n\n#### From the code modified above, you can see that we added a new function called airdropNfts().

To \n\n#### customize our KIP37Contract, follow the steps below: \n\n#### 1. Navigate to wizard.klaytn.foundation. \n\n#### 2. On the Contracts tab select KIP37 \n\n#### 3.

Recently, the Foundry team came up with a more user friendly way of \n\n#### declaratively deploying contracts using Solidity called Solidity Scripting i.e writing deployment scripts in \n\n#### solidity instead of JavaScript. \n\n#### In this section, we will deploy our contract using solidity scripting in Foundry. \n\n### Environment Configuration \n\n#### We’re going to deploy our generated smart contract to the Kaia Kairos Testnet, but to do this we’ll need \n\n#### to configure Foundry a bit, by setting things like a Kairos RPC URL, the private key of an account that’s \n\n#### funded with test KAIA. \n\n#### Once you have all that, create a .env file and add the variables. Foundry automatically loads in a .env file \n\n#### present in your project directory. \n\n#### The .env file should follow this format: \n\nWe now need to edit the (^) foundry.toml file. There should already be one in the root of the project. \n\n#### Paste the following lines to the end of the file \n\n### Writing the Script \n\n##### KAIROS_RPC_URL= \n\n // if you want to deploy to mainnet MAINNET_RPC_URL= PRIVATE_KEY= \n\n [rpc_endpoints] kairos = \"${KAIROS_RPC_URL}\" // if you want to deploy to mainnet mainnet = \"${MAINNET_RPC_URL}\" \n\n Make this page better \n\n\n#### Next, we have to create a folder and name it script if it doesn’t already exist. We then need to create a \n\n#### script file for our contracts namely: airdropKIP7.s.sol airdropKIP17.s.sol KIP37MultiToken.s.sol This is \n\n#### where we will write the deployment script itself. The contents of each file should look like this: \n\n#### 1. airdropKIP7.s.sol \n\n#### 2. airdropKIP17.s.sol \n\n#### 3. KIP37MultiToken.s.sol \n\n // SPDX-License-Identifier: UNLICENSED pragma solidity ^0.8.13; import \"forge-std/Script.sol\"; import \"../src/airdropKIP7.sol\"; \n\n contract KIP7AirdropDeployScript is Script { \n\n function setUp() public {} \n\n function run() public { uint256 deployerPrivateKey = vm.envUint(\"PRIVATE_KEY\"); \n\n vm.startBroadcast(deployerPrivateKey); \n\n KIP7TokenAirdrop kip7TokenAirdrop = new KIP7TokenAirdrop(); \n\n vm.stopBroadcast(); } } \n\n // SPDX-License-Identifier: UNLICENSED pragma solidity ^0.8.13; import \"forge-std/Script.sol\"; import \"../src/airdropKIP17.sol\"; \n\n contract KIP17AirdropDeployScript is Script { \n\n function setUp() public {} \n\n function run() public { uint256 deployerPrivateKey = vm.envUint(\"PRIVATE_KEY\"); \n\n vm.startBroadcast(deployerPrivateKey); \n\n KIP17NftAirdrop kip17NftTokenAirdrop = new KIP17NftAirdrop(); \n\n vm.stopBroadcast(); } } \n\n // SPDX-License-Identifier: UNLICENSED \n\n Make this page better \n\n\n#### Let’s go through what each line of code does. \n\n#### First we declared the SPDX-license and pragma version for each script file. Note that because each \n\n#### script file is a solidity program, we still need to declare the SPDX-license and pragma version, making it \n\n#### work like a smart contract, but is never deployed. \n\n#### Next we imported Forge Std/Script.sol which provides some scripting utilities to use for deploying our \n\n#### contracts. Subsequently, we imported the contract to be deployed. In this case airdropKIP7 , \n\n#### airdropKIP17 , KIP37MultiToken for each script. \n\n#### We then created a contract called KIP7AirdropDeployScript , KIP17AirdropDeployScript , \n\n#### KIP37MultiTokenDeployScript for each script file which inherits Script from Forge Std library. \n\n#### Next we declared the run() function. The function run() is the entry point for scripts to be executed. We \n\n#### then declared a deployerPrivateKey variable that loads in the private key from our .env file. \n\n#### Subsequently, we called the vm.startBroadcast(deployerPrivateKey) special cheat code that records \n\n#### calls and contract creations made by our main script contract, having passed the deployerPrivateKey for \n\n#### signing the transactions. \n\n#### We then created the respective contract. This contract creation will be recorded by forge because we \n\n#### previously called the vm.startBroadcast() cheat code. \n\n#### Now that we have gotten an overview of what each line entails, you can move on to deploy the contracts. \n\n#### Click this link, to learn more about writing scripts and other details. \n\n#### At the root of the project run \n\n pragma solidity 0.8.13; import \"forge-std/Script.sol\"; import \"../src/KIP37MultiToken.sol\"; \n\n contract KIP37MultiTokenDeployScript is Script { \n\n function setUp() public {} \n\n function run() public { \n\n uint256 deployerPrivateKey = vm.envUint(\"PRIVATE_KEY\"); \n\n vm.startBroadcast(deployerPrivateKey); \n\n KIP37MultiToken kip37MultiToken = new KIP37MultiToken(); \n\n vm.stopBroadcast(); } } \n\n // To load the variables in the .env file^ Make^ this^ page^ better \n\n\n#### To deploy the each contract run the command below: \n\n#### 1. airdropKIP7 \n\n#### 2. airdropKIP17 \n\n#### 3.

    " Core Concepts Kaia Network Identifier \n\n# Kaia Network Identifier \n\n**KNI (Kaia Network Identifier)** is a URL scheme to identify a Kaia node. Its syntax is shown below: \n\n**nodeID** is a 512-bit public key corresponding to the node’s private key. It is used to verify communication with peers on p2p network. \n\n**hostname** describes the address of a node, located between @ and :. The address format can be one of the following: \n\n IPv4 dotted decimal ( 192.0.2.1 ) \n\nIPv6 ( (^) [2001:db8::68] ) IPv4-mapped IPv6 ( [2001:db8:3c4d:15::abcd:ef12] ) Domain name ( your.node.com ) **port** is used to make connections with peer nodes through TCP. In Kaia, the default port is 32323 and the default subport is 32324. Note that the default subport is configured as port + 1 in kend.conf. Depending on the number of TCP listening ports, Kaia offers two^ types of connections. **discport** is used for checking if the known neighbors are reachable kaia nodes and fetching their neighbors' addresses for new connections. Note that this is a UDP port. By default, the UDP port, or discport , uses the same port with the TCP port. If the node uses a different port for^ discport , it can be specified by the discport query parameter. The following two URLs shows a KNI example of a node having IP address 10.0.0.1^ and TCP listening port 32323 and 32324. If discport is omitted, it is set to the UDP port of 32323 , same as the value of port. kni://<nodeID>@<hostname>:<port>?subport=<subport>&discport=<discport> kni://a979...163c@10.0.0.1:32323 # either single-channel or multi-channel Make this page better \n\n\nThe next two shows KNI examples of nodes having (^) discport of 30301.

    " Kaia Overview \n\n# Kaia Overview \n\nKaia is a highly optimized, BFT-based public blockchain designed to meet enterprise-grade reliability and performance standards. This overview details Kaia’s architecture, features, and ecosystem. \n\n## Key Design Goals \n\nKaia blockchain aims to: \n\n Achieve immediate finality for transactions. Provide high transaction processing speed for real-world use cases. Lower the cost of running blockchain applications. Reduce barriers to entry for end-users. Facilitate easy technology adoption for various industries. \n\n## Core Specifications \n\nKaia blockchain offers: \n\n 1-second block generation and confirmation time. Processing capability of 4,000 transactions per second. Low gas price, approximately 1/10 of Ethereum. EVM (Ethereum Virtual Machine) compatibility, supporting Solidity contracts. Governance by reputable corporations worldwide forming Kaia Governance Council. \n\n## Network Architecture \n\nKaia’s network is structured into three logical subnetworks: \n\n\n1. **Core Cell Network (CCN)** : Consists of Core Cells (CCs) responsible for transaction verification,     execution, and block creation. \n\n2. **Endpoint Node Network (ENN)** : Composed of Endpoint Nodes (ENs) that handle RPC API requests     and process data for service chains. \n\n3. **Service Chain Network (SCN)** : Auxiliary blockchains independently operated by dApps, connected     to the main chain via ENs. \n\n### Node Types \n\n\n1. **Core Cell (CC)** : Composed of one Consensus Node (CN) and two Proxy Nodes (PNs). \n\n Consensus Node (CN) : Participates in block generation. Proxy Node (PN) : Provides network interface, transmits transaction requests, and propagates blocks. \n\n2. **Endpoint Node (EN)** : Serves as network endpoints, handling API requests and data processing. \n\n3. **Bootnode** : Special nodes operated by Kaia to help new nodes join the network. \n\n## Consensus Algorithm \n\nKaia uses an optimized version of Istanbul BFT, implementing Practical Byzantine Fault Tolerance (PBFT) with blockchain-specific modifications. The consensus process involves: \n\n1. Election of a committee (proposer and validator) using Verifiable Random Function (VRF). \n\n2. Block generation by the elected proposer. \n\n3. Block verification and signing by the committee. \n\n\nThis consensus mechanism enables Kaia to achieve high performance, processing 4,000 transactions per second with instant transaction finality. \n\n## Block Generation and Propagation \n\n Blocks are generated in rounds, targeting a 1-second interval. Proposer and committee selection is random but deterministic. Blocks require signatures from more than two-thirds of committee members. Separate propagation channels for blocks and transactions (multichannel approach) manage network congestion. \n\n## Kaia Virtual Machine (KVM) \n\nThe Kaia Virtual Machine (KVM) provides a robust environment for smart contract execution: \n\n Based on the Ethereum Virtual Machine (EVM). Supports all EVM opcodes and additional Kaia-specific precompiled contracts. Compatible with Solidity and Ethereum development tools (e.g. Remix, Hardhat, Foundry). Allows developers to port Ethereum smart contracts to Kaia with minimal modifications. \n\n## Security Measures \n\nKaia implements several security measures: \n\n VRF for random selection of block proposers, adding unpredictability to the process. Separation of validator keys and reward keys to protect validators from potential key theft. Transparent block verification process, with all committee members verifying signatures on proposed blocks. \n\n## Interoperability \n\nKaia is designed for seamless interaction with other blockchain networks: \n\n EVM-compatible, allowing easy deployment of Ethereum smart contracts. Designed to interoperate with other EVM-SDK based chains. Supports cross-platform transactions and smart contract execution. \n\n\n## Token Economy \n\nKaia’s native token, KAIA, plays a central role in the blockchain’s economy: \n\n KAIA tokens are issued automatically with each new block. Initial annual inflation rate: 5.2%. Block rewards are distributed as follows: CCO and Community: 50% (20% Block Creator rewards, 80% Staking rewards) KEF (Kaia Ecosystem Fund): 25% KIF (Kaia Infrastructure Fund): 25% \n\nThis distribution model incentivizes network participation while supporting the growth and development of the Kaia ecosystem. \n\n## Governance \n\nKaia implements an on-chain governance system designed to be fair and inclusive: \n\n Voting rights are proportional to the amount of KAIA tokens staked. A cap on voting rights prevents suppression of minority opinions. Delegation of voting power is allowed. All governance proposals are recorded on-chain, ensuring transparency. \n\n## Auditability and Transparency \n\nKaia prioritizes transparency and auditability: \n\n All transactions provide an immutable and verifiable history of state changes. Two primary tools for blockchain exploration: Kaiascope: A comprehensive blockchain explorer. Kaiascan: A user-friendly interface for quick blockchain data lookups. The \"Square\" voting platform discloses all expenses and quarterly known transactions. \n\n## Network Monitoring \n\nTo ensure optimal performance and reliability, Kaia implements: \n\n A multi-channel approach to manage network congestion. Dedicated network monitoring for all validators. Make^ this^ page^ better \n\n\nEdit this page Last updated on **Jan 24, 2025** \n\n\n",
    " Tools Wallets Kaia Safe Kaia Safe API-Kit \n\n# Kaia Safe API Kit \n\n#### API-Kit is your go-to kit for securely interacting with the Safe Transaction API. The core of this kit is to \n\n#### allow valid signers to propose and share transactions with the other signers of a Safe, send the \n\n#### signatures to the service to collect them, and get information about a Safe (like reading the transaction \n\n#### history, pending transactions, enabled Modules and Guards, etc.), among other features. \n\n## Quickstart \n\n#### By the end of this guide, you will be able to propose transactions to the service and obtain the owners' \n\n#### signatures for execution. \n\n## Prerequisites \n\n#### 1. Node.js and npm \n\n#### 2. A Safe with several signers \n\n## Set up environment \n\n## Step 1: Create a project directory. \n\n#### Copy and paste this command in your terminal to create the project folder. \n\n## Step 2: Initialize an npm project. \n\n#### Copy and paste this command in your terminal to create a package.json^ file. \n\n## Step 3: Install dependencies. \n\n mkdir kaiasafe-api-kit cd kaiasafe-api-kit \n\n npm init y \n\n Make this page better \n\n\n#### Using API-Kit is as simple as running the installation command below: \n\n#### npm yarn \n\n### Step 4: Import dependencies. \n\n#### Create a file named app.js. This is where all our code snippets for this interaction would live. \n\nCopy and paste these necessary imports at the top of the (^) app.js file. \n\n### Step 5: Configure Setup \n\n#### To efficiently illustrate how API-Kit works, we will use a Safe account setup with two or more signers, and \n\n#### threshold two, so we have multiple signatures that need to be collected when executing a transaction. \n\nCopy and paste the following under the import statements in your (^) app.js file: \n\n## Use API Kit \n\n### Step 1: Initialize API Kit \n\n#### To initialize API Kit, we need to create an instance of the API Kit. \n\n#### In chains where the Safe Transaction Service is supported, it’s enough to specify the chainId \n\n#### property. \n\n npm install @safe-global/api-kit @safe-global/protocol-3 @safe-global/safe-core-sdk-types \n\n import SafeApiKit from '@safe-global/api-kit' import Safe from '@safe-global/protocol-kit' import { OperationType } from '@safe-global/safe-core-sdk-types' \n\n // https://chainlist.org/?search=kaia&testnets=true const RPC_URL = 'https://public-en-kairos.node.kaia.io' const SAFE_ADDRESS = \"<REPLACE WITH SAFE PUBLIC ADDRESS HERE>\"; // 2 Owner Safe Address const OWNER_1_ADDRESS = \"<REPLACE WITH OWNER 1 PUBLIC KEY HERE>\"; // ONLY OWNER 1 and SAF const OWNER_1_PRIVATE_KEY = \"<REPLACE WITH OWNER 1 PRIVATE KEY HERE>\"; const OWNER_2_PRIVATE_KEY = \"<REPLACE WITH OWNER 2 PRIVATE KEY HERE>\"; // OWNER 2 need no const TO_ADDRESS = OWNER_1_ADDRESS; // Receiver address of sample transaction who receive \n\n Make this page better \n\n\n#### As you can see above, we included custom service using the optional txServiceUrl property. \n\n### Step 2: Initialize Protocol Kit \n\n#### To handle transactions and signatures, we need to create an instance of the Protocol Kit (a kit that \n\n#### enables developers to interact with Safe Smart Accounts using a TypeScript interface) with the provider, \n\n#### signer and safeAddress. \n\n### Step 3: Propose a transaction to the service \n\n#### One of the core features of API Kit is to enable valid signers to share transactions with other signers. But \n\n#### before this is done, any of the Safe signers needs to initiate the process by creating a proposal of a \n\n#### transaction. This transaction is then sent to the service to make it accessible by the other owners so \n\n#### they can give their approval and sign the transaction as well. \n\n const apiKit = new SafeApiKit.default({ chainId: 1001 n, txServiceUrl: 'https://docs-safe.kaia.io/txs-baobab/api' }) \n\n const protocolKitOwner1 = await Safe.default.init({ provider: RPC_URL, signer: OWNER_1_PRIVATE_KEY, safeAddress: SAFE_ADDRESS }) \n\n const safeTransactionData = { to: TO_ADDRESS, value: ' 1 ', // 1 wei data: '0x', operation: OperationType.Call } const safeTransaction = await protocolKitOwner1.createTransaction({ transactions: [safeTransactionData] }) const safeTxHash = await protocolKitOwner1.getTransactionHash(safeTransaction) const signature = await protocolKitOwner1.signHash(safeTxHash) // 2.

    " Tools Wallets Kaia Safe \n\n# Kaia Safe \n\nIn a typical blockchain platform like Kaia, most users are familiar with single key wallet systems such as Kaia Wallet and MetaMask, which are also known as externally owned accounts (EOA). These accounts make use of traditional key pairs, i.e., public keys and private keys, which isn’t ideal as the private key creates a single point of failure. \n\nThis makes EOAs unsuitable for organisational use, as a compromised private key could lead to the organisation losing all of its crypto funds—such was the case in the Wintermute hack where $162.5 million was lost. \n\nThis is where multisig wallets like Kaia Safe come in. Unlike single key wallets, a multi-sig wallet needs multiple parties' private keys to sign and execute a transaction, removing the single point of failure and providing greater security for organisational use cases. \n\n## What are MultiSig Wallets? \n\nAs the name implies, a multi-signature wallet is a digital wallet that requires two, three, or more private keys from different sources to confirm and execute a crypto transaction. \n\nFor example, you can imagine a multi-signature wallet as a safe that has three locks. The three keys required to open the safe are with three different individuals, thus requiring their joint consent to open. \n\nHere are the main benefits of multisig wallets: \n\n Store assets/funds securely: Companies and protocols can store their funds safely without worrying about a private key leak or one bad actor moving funds without authorization. \n\n Enable decentralised decision making: Companies and business executives can make on-chain decisions on which transactions to execute. \n\n Two-factor authentication: With the help of multisig wallets, businesses and individuals can make sure that only those with access to the necessary keys can execute transactions. \n\nNext, we will dive into Kaia Safe, a multisig wallet for Klatyn, and how to use it to manage your funds and transactions. \n\n## What is Kaia Safe? \n\n Make this page better \n\n\nKaia Safe is a multisig wallet for the Kaia ecosystem. It is a fork of the well-known multisig wallet Gnosis Safe. \n\n## Benefits \n\n Store and transfer KAIA and KCTs (KIP7, KIP17) : Users can deposit and transfer cryptocurrencies (KAIA) and tokens (fungible or non-fungible). \n\n Flexibility and security: The confirmation threshold gives users more flexibility and control over which transactions should be executed, and removes the single point of failure. \n\n Safe apps: Kaia Safe’s functionality is expanded by the addition of custom apps that enable batch transactions and interaction with other dApps. One example of this safe app is the Transaction Builder which combines and executes multiple transactions as a batch transaction. \n\n Account recovery: In the event of lost keys, Kaia Safe accounts can be recovered as long as the confirmation threshold can still be met by the remaining keys. \n\nEdit this page Last updated on **Jan 24, 2025** \n\n Is this page helpful? \n\n Make this page better \n\n\n",
    " Core Concepts Smart Contracts \n\n# Kaia Smart Contracts \n\nThe Kaia Blockchain leverages the power of smart contracts, recognizing their importance in driving innovation and functionality within the ecosystem. Here’s a closer look at the concept of smart contracts within the Kaia Blockchain: \n\n## What are Smart Contracts? \n\nSmart contracts on the Kaia Blockchain are essentially self-executing digital agreements written in code. These contracts exist on the blockchain, giving them unique characteristics: \n\n Immutable : Once deployed, the code cannot be altered, guaranteeing the integrity and permanence of the agreement. Transparent : The code and all transaction history associated with a smart contract are publicly viewable on the blockchain, ensuring transparency and accountability. Secure : Protected by the robust cryptographic principles of the Kaia Blockchain, making them highly resistant to tampering or unauthorized modifications. \n\n## Kaia Virtual Machine (KVM): Powering Smart \n\n## Contracts \n\nKaia Blockchain utilizes a specialized virtual machine called the Kaia Virtual Machine (KVM) to execute smart contracts. The KVM is a derivative of the widely-used Ethereum Virtual Machine (EVM), providing key advantages: \n\n Developer-Friendly : Developers familiar with Ethereum can easily migrate existing smart contracts to Kaia or build new ones using familiar tools, languages (like Solidity), and development environments. Enhanced Functionality : While maintaining full compatibility with EVM opcodes, the KVM introduces additional precompiled contracts unique to Kaia, expanding the capabilities for developers. To avoid conflicts with existing EVM precompiled contracts, Kaia’s precompiled contract addresses are assigned in descending order from 0x03ff. \n\nWhen a smart contract is deployed on Kaia, it receives a unique address on the blockchain, much like a digital mailbox. Users interact with the contract by sending transactions to this address. These transactions can trigger a variety of actions predefined in the contract’s code, such as: Make this page better \n\n\n Token Transfers : Automatically transfer tokens between accounts based on predefined conditions. Data Storage : Store and retrieve data securely and transparently on the blockchain. Complex Logic Execution : Execute more sophisticated logic and computations based on the contract’s rules. \n\n## What are Smart Contracts used for on Kaia? \n\nSmart contracts are highly versatile and power a wide array of applications within the Kaia ecosystem: \n\n Decentralized Applications (dApps) : Smart contracts serve as the foundation for building and running dApps on Kaia. This enables the creation of decentralized exchanges, lending platforms, prediction markets, gaming applications, and much more. Tokenization of Assets : Smart contracts can represent and manage real-world assets like gold, real estate, intellectual property, or even digital items as unique tokens on the blockchain. This process, known as tokenization, unlocks liquidity and creates new opportunities for fractional ownership and trading. Automated Governance : Kaia’s on-chain governance system relies on smart contracts to ensure transparency and fairness. These contracts facilitate voting mechanisms, automatically implement changes based on voting outcomes, and provide a tamper-proof record of all governance decisions. System Contracts : Kaia itself utilizes smart contracts to manage critical aspects of its protocol. These system contracts handle tasks such as validator registration, network parameter updates, and the execution of governance mechanisms, further enhancing transparency and security. \n\n## Benefits of Smart Contracts on Kaia \n\nThe use of smart contracts on the Kaia Blockchain offers numerous benefits, including: \n\n Increased Efficiency : Automating agreements and processes eliminates the need for intermediaries, significantly reducing time, costs, and potential points of friction. Enhanced Security : Immutability, transparency, and cryptographic security work together to minimize the risks of fraud, manipulation, or security breaches. Improved Transparency : All transactions and interactions with smart contracts are recorded on the blockchain, providing a publicly auditable trail and fostering trust and accountability. Trustless Environment : Smart contracts remove the reliance on trust between parties. The code itself acts as the impartial enforcer of the agreement, ensuring all parties adhere to the predefined rules. Affordable Smart Contract Execution Cost : Kaia prioritizes affordable smart contract execution. Blockchains often charge fees for contract execution to encourage efficient code and deter malicious actors. However, high fees can hinder adoption. Kaia addresses this by using an opcodebased fixed fee model with a low unit cost per opcode. This is achieved through Kaia’s enhanced \n\n Make this page better \n\n\n scalability, which includes vertically scaling each CN node with high-end hardware, parallelizing computation via service chains, and horizontally scaling physical clusters. This combination allows for significantly lower opcode costs compared to other platforms, fostering broader adoption and innovation. \n\nIn essence, smart contracts are fundamental building blocks of the Kaia Blockchain. They empower developers to create a diverse range of decentralized applications and services, fostering innovation and expanding the possibilities of what’s achievable on the blockchain. The use of smart contracts within the Kaia ecosystem promotes transparency, security, and efficiency, paving the way for a more equitable and accessible decentralized future. \n\nEdit this page Last updated on **Jan 24, 2025** \n\n Is this page helpful? \n\n Make this page better \n\n\n",
    " Tutorials Kaia Wallet DApp Integration \n\n# Kaia Wallet DApp Integration \n\n## Table of Contents \n\n1. UI Libraries \n\n2. Utility Libraries \n\n3. Providers \n\n## Introduction \n\nKaia Wallet is a non-custodial wallet, similar to Metamask, with additional support for Kaia-specific Transactions & Accounts. This article will guide you through integrating Kaia Wallet with a decentralized application (dApp), from High-level (abstract) to Low-level (fine-grained) implementations. \n\nFor the sake of this guide, we will be dividing Kaia Wallet dApp integration into three main categories: \n\n UI Libraries Utility libraries Providers \n\n NOTE The aforementioned libraries use Providers under the hood. \n\n## 1. UI Libraries \n\nMany dApps utilize frontend frameworks for state management & delivering reactive services. The recommended way to integrate Kaia Wallet with such dApps is to use a UI Library built on the same framework. \n\nUI Libraries provide components for user interactions, like ConnectWallet component. They also save you the hassle of managing low-level states, like Multiple Accounts & Multiple Networks. You can look at the underlying Utility Library or Provider for complex or low-level interactions. \n\nWhile most UI libraries have built-in support for Metamask, integrating Kaia Wallet is also easy since its API is built on Metamask's. Even if a library doesn’t natively support Kaia Wallet, extending it for Kaia Wallet integration is straightforward. For example, these are 2 popular libraries for React^ Make or^ this Next.js^ page^ better: \n\n\n Appkit Web3-Onboard \n\n### 1.1. Appkit example \n\nBy Reown, Appkit offers the following **Features:** \n\n Buttons + Modals for Connect Wallet, Account information, & Network information Support for Email Wallets, Coinbase accounts, & EIP-4361 \n\n**Considerations:** \n\n Using @reown/appkit, you have an option to commit to either the frontend stack of Wagmi & Tanstack Query or simply Ethers Requires a projectId signup w/ Reown \n\n NOTE Example Code: kaikas-web3modal \n\n### 1.2. Web3-Onboard example \n\nBy Blocknative, Web3-Onboard offers the following **Features:** \n\n Make this page better \n\n\n Configurable Onboard text Modals for Connect Wallet, Switch Account, & Switch Network Notification Components (Optional) Register API Key(s) to fetch & render real-time data \n\n**Considerations:** \n\n You'll have to write your Buttons \n\n NOTE Example Code: kaikas-web3onboard-react \n\n## 2. Utility Libraries \n\nLibraries like kaia-sdk & ethers.js abstract just enough to streamline blockchain interactions while still being able to call Provider APIs directly. \n\nUsing Utility Libraries to connect an account or send native tokens (e.g., KAIA/ETH) will be no different, in terms of syntax & lines of code, from calling Providers directly. Where libraries mainly improve are in the following areas: \n\n Smart Contract interactions These involve ABIs, encoding inputs, & decoding outputs. Without a library, the code for these can be verbose & error-prone. Error-handling string error codes/messages are mapped to error Classes with custom properties & methods. Documentation & Type-safety \n\n### 2.1. kaia-sdk \n\nkaia-sdk is a set of drop-in extensions for other Utility Libraries, like ethers.js & web3.js. It allows you to use your preferred library while exposing first-party support for Kaia-specific methods: \n\n Transaction, Account, & Account Key types Fee Delegation \n\n NOTE Example Code: kaikas-web3klaytn \n\n Make this page better \n\n\n### 2.2. ethers.js example \n\nethers.js is the most popular JavaScript Utility Library for interacting with the blockchain. It aims to be: \n\n Extensive: support for multiple wallet formats, languages, & functions Robust: comprehensive tests, documentation, & typing \n\n NOTE Example Code: kaikas-ethersjs \n\n## 3. Providers \n\nAt the lowest level is the Provider, window.klaytn (Kaia Wallet itself). You might prefer Utility Libraries, but knowledge of Provider APIs helps debug & understand how dependent libraries work. Referring to [Kaia’s JSON-RPC API][Kaia-API] is necessary for using Kaia-specific methods like kaia_getAccount , kaia_sendTransactionAsFeePayer ,^ &^ more. \n\nEdit this page Last updated on **Jan 24, 2025** \n\n Is this page helpful? \n\n Make this page better \n\n\n",
    " Tools Wallets Kaia Wallet \n\n# Kaia Wallet \n\nKaia Wallet is a browser extension wallet for the Kaia Network. Available in Google Chrome, Kaia Wallet provides a secure and usable means to interact with the Kaia network via web browser. With Kaia Wallet, you are able to store and transact with your KAIA and Kaia-based tokens. You are also able to sign requests from web-based dApps (Decentralized Applications) in realtime. \n\n Download from Chrome Web Store: link \n\nFor developers, please visit https://docs.kaiawallet.io to learn how you can develop dApps using Kaia Wallet. \n\n## PC web browser based decentralized HD wallet \n\nKaia Wallet is a web browser extension available in Chrome. Kaia Wallet is optimized for the desktop environment. \n\nKaia Wallet offers manageability of user accounts and keys. All transactions are transparently recorded on the Kaia blockchain, so anybody can access the transaction history by using Kaiascope. \n\nKaia Wallet is a Hierarchical Deterministic (HD) wallet, meaning that it generates a hierarchical tree-like structure of private/public keys indefinitely from a single seed phrase. The seed phrase consists of mnemonic code words, which makes it easier to remember than phrases made of random alphanumerics. Users' private keys are encrypted and stored in their browsers. \n\nWith the features described above, Kaia Wallet has improved the security, transparency, and userfriendliness of the current blockchain experience. However, it is vital for users to be responsible for managing their personal accounts. For example, if a user couldn’t remember his/her seed phrase, there would be no other way to restore his/her accounts. Make^ this^ page^ better \n\n\n## Supporting various Kaia networks and tokens \n\nKaia Wallet allows you to store and transact with all Kaia-based tokens including KAIA. Tokens that are not loaded by default can be inserted by pasting in their contract address. You can even store and transact your own Kaia-based custom tokens on Kaia Wallet! \n\nKaia Wallet supports Kaia’s Kairos testnet as well as the Mainnet. Moreover, Kaia Wallet supports the private chains for Kaia-based dApp developers who may wish to circulate custom tokens in their private network. \n\n## Signing web-based dApp transactions \n\nKaia Wallet simply bridges the gap between you and dApps, empowering you to sign transactions/data flowing to you from dApps with Kaia Wallet account. Kaia Wallet is also an aidful utility for developers to handle fee-delegated transactions. Using Kaia Wallet, both transaction senders and fee payers can swiftly sign the fee-delegated transactions. \n\nEdit this page Last updated on **Jan 24, 2025** \n\n Is this page helpful? \n\n Make this page better \n\n\n",
    " Token Economics Kaia native coin KAIA \n\n# Kaia native coin KAIA \n\n## KAIA \n\nKAIA is the main internal transferable cryptocurrency of Kaia and is used to pay transaction fees when creating or executing smart contracts or when transferring KAIA. \n\nKAIA is a necessary element--a fuel--for operating the Kaia distributed application platform. It is a form of payment made by the clients of the platform to the consensus nodes (CNs) executing the requested \n\noperations. To put it another way, KAIA is an incentive; it ensures that developers write high-quality applications (wasteful code costs more) and that the network remains healthy (CNs are compensated for the resources they contribute). \n\n## Units of KAIA \n\nKaia uses the following unit system for KAIA. \n\n kei is the smallest currency unit. A Gkei is 10^9 kei. A KAIA^ is 10^18 kei. \n\n Unit kei value kei \n\n kei 1 kei 1 \n\n Gkei 10^9 kei 1,000,000,000 \n\n KAIA 10^18 kei 1,000,000,000,000,000,000 \n\n## Historical Pricing \n\nYou can download historical price data for the former KLAY and FNSA tokens using the following links: \n\n Download KLAY historical pricing Download FNSA historical pricing Make this page better \n\n\nEdit this page Last updated on **Jan 24, 2025** \n\n Is this page helpful? \n\n Make this page better \n\n\n",

    " Transition to Kaia Kaiabridge \n\n# Kaiabridge \n\nFinschia users can swap their FNSA tokens on Finshia network to KAIA tokens on Kaia network at a fixed swap rate. The swap is mediated by a set of smart contract and programs, collectively called Kaiabridge. \n\nA token swap process begins with the Finschia user sending the FNSA token to the fwsap module. The \n\ntoken is first swapped from (^) cony to (^) kei denomination, then transferred to (^) fbridge module. The event from (^) fbridge is recognized by the trusted relayers and submitted to bridge smart contracts on Kaia chain. The bridging request is handled in multiple steps: Inflight: The token arrived in Finschia’s fbridge module, but the relayers did not report to the Kaia smart contracts. Confirmed: The relayers submitted the request to the contracts (\"provision\"). Now the request enters a 30 minute timelock. Claimed: After the timelock has expired, the token has been transferred (\"claim\") to the destination account on Kaia chain. Kaiabridge smart contracts has built-in multisig features. For instance, it takes multiple provision transactions from the Operator accounts for a request to be Confirmed. Each Operator account is held by a relayer, and the relayers are managed by Kaia Foundation and Finschia Foundation.

Kaia has Ethereum compatibility \n\n## 4. Migrate App \n\n## 1. Introduction \n\n## This tutorial is intended to give a guide on how to migrate an Ethereum App to Kaia. No previous Kaia \n\n## experience is needed. We will focus only on the code modifications required to migrate an Ethereum App \n\n## to Kaia. \n\n## 2. Prerequisites \n\n## Familiarity with developer tooling and standards that support EVM. \n\n## Basic knowledge building a dApp. \n\n## 3. Kaia has Ethereum compatibility \n\n## Kaia runtime environment is compatible with Ethereum Virtual Machine and executes smart contracts \n\n## written in Solidity. Kaia’s RPC APIs and other client libraries maintain almost identical API specifications \n\n## with Ethereum’s whenever available. Therefore, it is fairly straightforward to migrate Ethereum Apps to \n\n## Kaia. This helps developers easily move to a new blockchain platform. \n\n## 4.

    " Core Cell Network Configuration \n\n# Network Configuration \n\nA Core Cell can be made up of: \n\n multiple subnets (recommended) a single subnet \n\n## A Core Cell with Multiple Subnets \n\nIt is recommended to have a two-layer subnet which is used in general web services such as DB + AppServer and Proxy Web Servers. This design of the subnet has more advantages on the security. \n\nSince monitoring servers are also required for managing all servers as another layer, the following section describes how to setup a Core Cell with a three-layer subnet. \n\nThe three-layer subnet consists of the following: \n\n CN Subnet PN Subnet Management (Mgmt) Subnet \n\n### CN Subnet \n\nA CN Subnet consists of CN servers in Core Cells. The working CN in a Core Cell is only one, but spare one should be prepared for high availability. IP/Port of all CNs within the Core Cell Network (CCN) must be opened to each other because they try to connect to the others from the outside of the Core Cell. (This connection information can be received from Kairos operators.) The internal communication with other subnets in the Core Cell requires to open default port (32323: default Kaia P2P port number) in order to connect to PNs of the PN Subnet. Furthermore, it is necessary to open other ports such as the CN monitoring port (61001) for the monitoring server and the SSH port (22) for the management purpose. If the multichannel feature is used, another port (32324: default multichannel port) should be opened as well. \n\n Make this page better \n\n\n Origin Subnet Target Subnet Ingress Egress \n\n CN Subnet PN Subnet P2P: 32323 (32324 for multichannel) All \n\n CN Subnet Mgmt Subnet SSH: 22, Monitoring: 61001 All \n\n CN Subnet Public (Internet) each CN’s IP and P2P port All \n\n### PN Subnet \n\nA PN Subnet consists of the PN servers to provide services in order to connect to the external ENs. \n\nA PN subnet is connected to the following nodes: \n\n CNs in Core Cells Make this page better \n\n\n Some PNs of other Core Cells Core Cell Management Servers (Mgmt, Monitoring) EN nodes \n\n Origin Subnet Target Subnet Ingress Egress \n\n PN Subnet CN Subnet P2P: 32323 (32324 for multichannel) All \n\n PN Subnet Mgmt Subnet SSH: 22, Monitoring: 61001 All \n\n PN Subnet Public (Internet) P2P: 32323 All \n\n### Mgmt Subnet \n\nA Mgmt Subnet is a gateway subnet for the operator to enter into the Core Cell nodes through ssh. A VPN server may be necessary to make the connection together with a monitoring server and a management server installed with a tool to manage the Core Cell nodes.

Firewall setup is also necessary for the CN to connect to other CNs within the CNN using P2P port (32323, 32324 for multichannel option). The P2P port of the PN is opened to connect with ENs in Endpoint Node Network (ENN) and PNs in the Core Cell Network (CNN). Additionally, an optional VPN and monitoring servers are required to be managed remotely. \n\n Make this page better \n\n\nEdit this page Last updated on **Jan 24, 2025** \n\n Is this page helpful? \n\n Make this page better \n\n\n",

    " Core Cell Node Security \n\n# Node Security \n\nNode security is a critical aspect of a secure blockchain network. Depending on the type of node, the operator needs to pay attention to security. \n\n Consensus Node (CN): CNs are responsible for proposing and validating new blocks. A compromised CN can create malicious blocks or disrupt the blockchain. Certainly, the misbehaviour of a few nodes is blocked by the BFT consensus. However, they can still cause bad blocks or round changes that degrade the stability of the network. Therefore, core cell operators should maintain their nodes responsibly. Proxy Node (PN): PNs communicate with nodes on the Internet on behalf of CNs. While a PN does not sign blocks by itself, a security breach of a PN can damage the network. Its p2p key can be used to connect to the CN’s restrictive network. A compromised PN can also neutralise the transaction filtering such as the spam filter. Endpoint Node (EN): ENs provide public access to the network for the applications. While an EN has no authority to manipulate the blocks, a security breach of an EN can pose trust issues. A compromised EN can serve false information including block data and account states. It can drop or censor incoming transactions if the app is directly connected to the EN. \n\n## Operation security \n\nFollow the security best practices whenever possible. To list a few: \n\n Keep the operating systems and installed software up-to-date. Enhance SSH security by disabling remote root login, switching off password-based login, and opting for public-key authentication. Always operate nodes on dedicated machines. To reduce the risk of malware via supply chain attacks, refrain from installing other software, especially the ones that connect to the Internet. The machine or virtual machine must be used for node operation purposes only. Install firewalls. Keep the open ports minimal and whitelist the maintenance and operator IP addresses. Be careful when opening the SSH, RPC, or debug ports. For CNs and PNs, the p2p port should be restricted to an explicit list of peer CN and PN IPs. Even if the p2p stack has a vulnerability the attack opportunity is effectively blocked or restricted to the known nodes. Prioritize cloud security. When the node is operating on cloud virtual machines, properly manage the cloud accounts (e.g. AWS IAM roles) according to the cloud provider’s best practices. The cloud accounts may not have access to SSH, but they can copy the disk contents or open a serial console. Make this page better \n\n\n## Key security \n\nThere are two major cryptographic keys managed by a node. \n\n Node key or p2p key: A 32-byte secp256k1 ECDSA private key. It’s used in the p2p rlpx communication as well as signing the blocks. BLS node key: A 32-byte BLS12-381 private key. It’s used to sign the RANDAO field in the blocks. \n\nBecause the signing must happen automatically unattended, those keys have to be stored on the disk or entered via the command line. At this point, node security is critical in protecting the keys from theft. \n\nIn the future, the nodes could support storing the keys in an external provider such as key management systems (KMS) or hardware security modules (HSM). Note that node security is still important even with these key management mechanisms. Although the keys cannot be copied, a compromised node can still initiate the signing of malicious payloads. On top of key theft, key loss is also a risk to manage. It is recommended to backup the node keys in an encrypted keystore file, and preserve in an offline storage. \n\nEdit this page Last updated on **Jan 24, 2025** \n\n Is this page helpful? \n\n Make this page better \n\n\n",
    "# Open Source \n\nThe virtue of public blockchains is that they share each other’s code and seek the development of general blockchain technology. Kaia is developed by forking Ethereum source code and referred various open source project technologies. Therefore, Kaia also tries to repay the blockchain ecosystem by open-sourcing code again. Especially, because lots of efforts were put in to achieve 1 second block generation time, the projects that are interested in reducing latency will make a good reference out of it. \n\nThe participation of the developer community at public blockchain is one of the important factors for success. Since the design of Kaia, Ethereum that is the strongest developer community is selected as base code considering this, and by protecting solidity compatibility as smart contract language, it is supporting original blockchain engineers to transfer to Kaia easily. Also, Ethereum Toolkits also tried to protect compatibility so that it is able to drive at Kaia with a little bit of modification. In contrast, tools developed for Kaia can also be used at Ethereum with a little bit of modification. Through this, we hope there are more opportunities for two platforms’ community to exchange with each other. \n\nBy open sourcing Kaia, we opened Kaia development to the community. So, all engineers can participate in Kaia development in various formats from translation, bug reporting to the code commit. We provide the Kaia Ecosystem Fund (KEF) support program to encourage the participation of open source developers. KEF is the program that offers for Kaia development at the community and receives funding to reach this. This makes financial support to be rewarded for enthusiastic participants. \n\nEdit this page Last updated on **Jan 24, 2025** \n\n Is this page helpful? \n\n Make this page better \n\n\n",
    " Tools Oracles \n\n# Oracles \n\nBlockchain oracles serve as a link between the blockchain and other external data sources. In actuality, the blockchain is a closed system; as such, it is unable to pull data into or out of any external systems (off-chain data) and only has access to data that is already present within the original blockchain context. This creates a blockchain-oracle issue where the blockchain is unable to obtain data from actual occurrences. Smart contracts must, however, connect to a wide range of external data sources in order to fulfill a number of useful functions. As an illustration, a hybrid smart contract that uses oracles to give asset prices for finance, weather data for insurance, randomness for gaming, IoT sensors for supply chain management, etc. \n\nThe need for blockchains to access and connect to external data sources, legacy systems, and advanced computation brought about oracles. The benefits of oracles in the blockchain industry cannot be underestimated, and it is therefore crucial to do your research before choosing your oracles when creating hybrid smart contracts. Avoiding centralized oracles is therefore encouraged since leveraging decentralized oracles is important for developing your decentralized apps. On one hand, centralized oracles are controlled by a single entity and, as such, have a single point of failure, making smart contracts vulnerable to attacks. On the other hand, decentralized oracles are designed to fly above the limitations of centralized oracles by eliminating the single point of failure. A decentralized oracle comprises multiple participants in a peer-to-peer network that form consensus on off-chain data before sending it to a smart contract. \n\nThe following providers have integrated with Kaia to deliver decentralized oracle services: \n\n Pyth Network Orakl Network Witnet SupraOracles KlayOracle \n\nEdit this page Last updated on **Jan 24, 2025** \n\n Is this page helpful? \n\n Make this page better \n\n\n",
    " Tools Oracles Orakl Network \n\n# Orakl Network \n\n## Introduction \n\n#### Orakl Network is a decentralized oracle network that allows smart contracts to securely access off-chain \n\n#### data and other resources. It prides itself in being a native token oracle that provides Data Feed, VRF, \n\n#### Request-Response and Proof of Reserve solutions. \n\n#### With Orakl Network, users can source for randomness that is unpredictable and unbiased in their smart \n\n#### contracts. Orakl Network Verifiable Random Function (VRF) allows smart contracts to generate verifiably \n\n#### random values, which can be used in various dApps that require randomness. Orakl Network provides \n\n#### developers access to the VRF services through two different account types, namely: Permanent \n\n#### Account or Temporary Account. \n\n#### In this tutorial, you will utilize the VRF functionality from Orakl Network to request for random words from \n\n#### inside of your smart contract. \n\n## Prerequisites \n\n#### Kaia Wallet \n\n#### Remix IDE \n\n#### Kaia Plugin on Remix \n\n#### Test KAIA from Faucet \n\n## Getting Started \n\n\n#### In the following steps, you will request for a random word in your smart contract using Orakl Network. \n\n#### Let’s get started! \n\n### Step 1: Initialize Contract State Variables \n\n#### In this step, we will define the cosumer contract and initialize the state variables needed for our contract \n\n#### functionality. Our consumer contract is dependent on VRFConsumerBase contract from which we \n\n#### inherit, and IVRFCoordinator interface that is used for calls to VRFCoordinator contract. Next, we \n\n#### define sRandomWord variable which we use to store the random word result and the sOwner variable \n\n#### which is used inside of onlyOwner modifier. \n\n### Step 2: Initialize VRF Coordinator \n\n#### To request for random words in your smart contract, you need to initialize the VRFCoordinator smart \n\ncontract. It is recommended to bond (^) VRFCoordinator interface with (^) VRFCoordinator address \n\n#### supplied through a constructor parameter, and use it for random word requests \n\n#### ( requestRandomWords^ ). The VRFCoordinator^ contract is deployed both on Kaia Kairos \n\n#### 0xDA8c0A00A372503aa6EC80f9b29Cc97C454bE499 and Kaia Mainnet \n\n#### 0x3F247f70DC083A2907B8E76635986fd09AA80EFb. \n\n### Step 3: Request Random Words with Temporary Account \n\n pragma solidity ^0.8.16; \n\n import { VRFConsumerBase } from \"@bisonai/orakl-contracts/src/v0.1/VRFConsumerBase.sol\"; import { IVRFCoordinator } from \"@bisonai/orakl-contracts/src/v0.1/interfaces/IVRFCoordin \n\n contract VRFConsumer is VRFConsumerBase { uint256 public sRandomWord; address private sOwner; \n\n error OnlyOwner ( address notOwner); modifier onlyOwner() { if ( msg.sender != sOwner) { revert OnlyOwner( msg.sender ); } _; } \n\n IVRFCoordinator COORDINATOR; \n\n constructor( address coordinator ) VRFConsumerBase(coordinator) { COORDINATOR = IVRFCoordinator(coordinator); sOwner = msg.sender ; } \n\n\n#### To request random words with a temporary account, users need to send $KAIA together with a call using \n\n#### value property. \n\n#### This function calls the requestRandomWords() function defined in COORDINATOR contract, and \n\npasses (^) keyHash , (^) callbackGasLimit , (^) numWords and (^) refundRecipient as arguments. The payment \n\n#### for service is sent through msg.value to the requestRandomWords() in COORDINATOR contract. If the \n\n#### payment is larger than expected payment, exceeding payment is returned to the refundRecipient \n\n#### address. Eventually, it generates a request for random words. To accurately specify msg.value for the \n\n#### requestRandomWords function, please refer to the explanation on how to estimate the service fee. \n\n### Step 4: Fulfill Random Words \n\nThe (^) fulfillRandomWords function is called by (^) VRFCoordinator contract when fulfilling the random \n\n#### words request. \n\n#### Now that we have the Orakl VRF solution code, let’s get to see it in action. \n\n function requestRandomWordsDirect( bytes32 keyHash , uint32 callbackGasLimit , uint32 numWords , address refundRecipient ) public payable onlyOwner returns ( uint256 requestId ) { requestId = COORDINATOR.requestRandomWords{value: msg .value}( keyHash, callbackGasLimit, numWords, refundRecipient ); } \n\n function fulfillRandomWords( uint256 /* requestId */, uint256 [] memory randomWords ) internal override { // requestId should be checked if it matches the expected request // Generate random value between 1 and 50. sRandomWord = (randomWords[ 0 ] % 50 ) + 1 ; } \n\n\n## Practical Implementation \n\n#### In the example below, the contract allows us to request for random words and receive its fulfillment. \n\n### Create and Deploy Sample Code \n\n#### Remix IDE \n\n#### Navigate to Remix IDE. \n\n#### Click on the File Explorer tab, create a new file named consumer-vrf.sol in the contracts folder. \n\n#### Paste the code below in your newly created file. \n\n#### In Remix, click Compile contract. \n\n#### Click the Kaia tab on your left having installed the plugin. \n\n#### Select Environment > Injected Provider Kaia Wallet. \n\nIn **Contract** , select your contract. For example, (^) VRFConsumer. \n\n#### Pass in the coordinator contract address 0xDA8c0A00A372503aa6EC80f9b29Cc97C454bE499 \n\n#### (Kairos), 0x3F247f70DC083A2907B8E76635986fd09AA80EFb (Mainnet). \n\n#### Click Deploy. \n\n#### Sample Code \n\n // SPDX-License-Identifier: MIT pragma solidity ^0.8.16; \n\n import { VRFConsumerBase } from \"@bisonai/orakl-contracts/src/v0.1/VRFConsumerBase.sol\"; import { IVRFCoordinator } from \"@bisonai/orakl-contracts/src/v0.1/interfaces/IVRFCoordinat \n\n contract VRFConsumer is VRFConsumerBase { uint256 public sRandomWord; address private sOwner; \n\n IVRFCoordinator COORDINATOR; \n\n error OnlyOwner ( address notOwner); \n\n modifier onlyOwner() { if ( msg.sender != sOwner) { revert OnlyOwner( msg.sender ); } _; } \n\n constructor( address coordinator ) VRFConsumerBase(coordinator) { sOwner = msg.sender ; COORDINATOR = IVRFCoordinator(coordinator); } \n\n function requestRandomWordsDirect(^ Make^ this^ page^ better \n\n\n### Interact with Smart Contract \n\n#### To request for random words in your smart contract, you have to first execute the \n\n#### requestRandomWordsDirect() function. For this function to successfully execute, the user has to \n\n#### send KAIA (minimum of 1 KAIA) as stated previously, and supply keyHash , callbackGasLimit , \n\n#### numWords , and refundRecipient parameters. keyHash parameter uniquely defines who can fulfill the \n\n#### request. Orakl Network VRF provides one key hash for each Kaia chain: \n\n#### Kairos: 0xd9af33106d664a53cb9946df5cd81a30695f5b72224ee64e798b278af812779c \n\n#### Mainnet: 0x6cff5233743b3c0321a19ae11ab38ae0ddc7ddfe1e91b162fa8bb657488fb157 \n\n#### For the rest of the parameters, you can set them as follows: \n\n#### callbackGasLimit as 500000 , \n\n bytes32 keyHash , uint32 callbackGasLimit , uint32 numWords , address refundRecipient ) public payable onlyOwner returns ( uint256 requestId ) { requestId = COORDINATOR.requestRandomWords{value: msg .value}( keyHash, callbackGasLimit, numWords, refundRecipient ); } \n\n function fulfillRandomWords( uint256 /* requestId */, uint256 [] memory randomWords ) internal override { // requestId should be checked if it matches the expected request // Generate random value between 1 and 50. sRandomWord = (randomWords[ 0 ] % 50 ) + 1 ; } } \n\n Make^ this^ page^ better \n\n\n#### numWords as^1 , and \n\n#### set refundRecipient to your EOA address. \n\n#### Afterwards, once the request has been fulfilled, the sRandomWord() function can be executed. This \n\n#### sRandomWord() function returns the random word. \n\n#### requestRandomWordsDirect() : Will be sending 1 KAIA to execute this function. The image below \n\n#### illustrate this: \n\n#### sRandomWord() : After the VRFCoordinator has fulfilled the random word request, the response \n\nis stored in the (^) sRandomWord variable. To get the response, call the (^) sRandomWord() function. \n\n#### Tada 🎉! You just requested for a random word and received one in your smart contract. \n\n\n## Conclusion \n\n#### In this tutorial, you learnt how to generate a random word in your smart contract using the Orakl Network \n\n#### VRF solution.

    " Core Concepts Smart Contracts Precompiled Contracts \n\n# Precompiled Contracts \n\n#### Kaia provides several useful precompiled contracts, none of which are state-changing. These contracts \n\n#### are implemented in the platform itself as a native implementation, which means they are part of the Kaia \n\n#### client specifications. The precompiled contracts from address 0x01 through 0x0A are the same as those \n\n#### in Ethereum. The utility of precompiles falls into four major categories:. Elliptic curve digital signature \n\n#### recovery.. Hash Methods. Memory copying. Methods to enable elliptic curve maths for zk proofs. Kaia \n\n#### additionally implements precompiled contracts from 0x3FD through 0x3FF to support new Kaia features. \n\n##### NOTE \n\n#### Contracts deployed before the istanbul EVM hardfork should use the original addresses. \n\n#### case 1) The contracts deployed in Kairos at block number #75373310 recognizes 0x09, 0x0a, \n\n#### and 0x0b as addresses of vmLog, feePayer, and validateSender, respectively, and blake2f \n\n#### cannot be used. \n\n#### case 2) The contracts deployed in Kairos at block number #75373314 recognizes 0x09 as the \n\n#### address of blake2f, and recognizes 0x3fd, 0x3fe, and 0xff as addresses of vmLog, feePayer, and \n\n#### validateSender. \n\n#### Precompiled contracts related hardfork changes can be found at the bottom of this page. Go to \n\n#### Hardfork Changes. \n\n## Address 0x01: ecrecover(hash, v, r, s) \n\n#### The address 0x01 implements ecrecover. It returns the address from the given signature by calculating a \n\n#### recovery function of ECDSA. It is the only precompile that comes with a solidity wrapper. Its function \n\n#### prototype is as follows: \n\n## Address 0x02: sha256(data) \n\n function ecRecover(bytes32 hash, uint8 v, bytes32 r, bytes32 s) public view returns (addr address r = ecrecover(hash, v, r, s); // prototype function require(r != address(0), \"signature is invalid\"); } // solidity wrapper \n\n Make this page better \n\n\n#### The address 0x02 implements SHA256 hash.

For \n\n#### more information, see debug_setVMLogTarget. Note that this precompiled contract should be used \n\n#### only for debugging purposes, and it is required to enable the --vmlog option when the Kaia node starts. \n\n#### Also, the log level of the Kaia node should be 4 or more to see the output of vmLog.

The following code can be used to call this precompiled contract. \n\n## Address 0x3ff: validateSender() \n\n#### The address 0x3FF validates the sender’s signature with the message. Since Kaia decouples key pairs \n\n#### from addresses, it is required to validate that a signature is properly signed by the corresponding \n\n#### sender.

    " Node Quick Reference Profile Node Data \n\n# Profile Node Data \n\n#### Profiling is an essential tool for understanding and optimizing the performance of Kaia nodes. This \n\n#### tutorial will guide you through various profiling techniques available for Kaia node operators, leveraging \n\n#### Kaia’s debug API and the net/http/pprof Go package. \n\n## Prerequisites \n\n#### Before you begin, ensure that: \n\n#### Node Setup: Your Kaia node is correctly installed and running. \n\n#### Access to Node Console: You'll need to interact with the node either via the node console. \n\n**Tools:** Go is installed on your system to use (^) go tool pprof and (^) go tool trace. You can verify \n\n#### by running: \n\n## 1. Managing Profiling: How to Start, Stop, and Check \n\n## Status \n\n#### Kaia nodes provide a debug^ API that offers several profiling methods. You can interact with these \n\n#### methods via the node’s console or through JSON-RPC API calls. \n\n## 1.1 Starting the pprof HTTP Server \n\n#### The pprof HTTP server allows you to collect and analyze profiling data efficiently. \n\n#### Accessing pprof Endpoints \n\n go version \n\n # Start pprof server with default settings (localhost:6060) > debug.startPProf() \n\n # Start pprof server on a specific address and port > debug.startPProf(\"localhost\", 8080 ) \n\n\n#### Once the pprof server is running, access the profiling data at: \n\n#### http://localhost:6060/debug/pprof/ — Overview of available profiles. \n\n#### http://localhost:6060/memsize/ — Memory size reports. \n\n#### http://localhost:6060/debug/vars — Exporter for Prometheus metrics. \n\n### 1.2 Stopping the pprof HTTP Server \n\n### 1.3 Checking if pprof is Running \n\n## 2. Collecting Profiles \n\n#### Once the pprof server is running, you can collect various profiles by using several methods to analyze \n\n#### your node’s performance. \n\n### 2.1 Collect Using Web Interface \n\n#### Enter the respective endpoints in your web browser to collect different profiles as shown in the following \n\n#### examples: \n\n#### Collect heap profile \n\n##### http://localhost:6060/debug/pprof/heap \n\n#### Collect 30-second CPU profile \n\n##### http://localhost:6060/debug/pprof/profile?seconds=30 \n\n#### Collect goroutine profile with debug=2 \n\n##### http://localhost:6060/debug/pprof/goroutine?debug=2 \n\n### 2.2 Collect Using API Calls \n\n > debug.stopPProf() \n\n > debug.isPProfRunning() true # if running false # if not running \n\n\n#### Type the respective commands in the node console to collect or configure profiles as shown in the \n\n#### following examples: \n\n**2.3 Collect Using** (^) **go tool pprof** \n\n#### If you cannot access the pprof web interface, you can generate and analyze profiling results locally \n\n#### using go tool pprof. \n\n#### Identify Available Profile Types \n\n#### The supported profiles include: \n\n#### allocs : A sampling of all past memory allocations. \n\n#### block : Stack traces that led to blocking on synchronization primitives. \n\n#### goroutine : Stack traces of all current goroutines. Use debug=2 as a query parameter to export in \n\n#### the same format as an unrecovered panic. \n\n#### heap : A sampling of memory allocations of live objects. You can specify the gc GET parameter to \n\n#### run garbage collection before taking the heap sample. \n\nmutex (^) : Stack traces of holders of contended mutexes. \n\n#### profile : CPU profile. You can specify the duration in the seconds GET parameter. After you get \n\n#### the profile file, use the go tool pprof command to investigate the profile. \n\n#### threadcreate : Stack traces that led to the creation of new OS threads. \n\n#### trace : A trace of execution of the current program. You can specify the duration in the seconds \n\n#### GET parameter. After you get the trace file, use the go^ tool^ trace^ command to investigate the \n\n#### trace. \n\n**Collect Profiles Using** (^) **go tool pprof** \n\n#### Replace <profiletype>^ with one of the supported profiles listed above (e.g., heap^ , profile^ ). \n\n#### Example Commands \n\n # Collect 30-second CPU profile > debug.cpuProfile(\"cpu.profile\", 30 ) \n\n # Collect 30-second block profile > debug.blockProfile(\"block.profile\", 30 ) \n\n # Set mutex profiling fraction > debug.setMutexProfileFraction(1) \n\n go tool pprof http://localhost:6060/debug/pprof/<profiletype> \n\n Make this page better \n\n\n#### Generating Text Profiling Files \n\n#### To generate text-based profiling reports, use the -text^ option with go^ tool^ pprof^. \n\n#### pprof Extra Options \n\n#### Profiling can be customized further using additional query parameters and options when collecting \n\n#### profiles. \n\n#### Response Format ( debug=N ): \n\n#### Binary Format (Default): N = 0 \n\n#### Plaintext Format: N > 0 \n\n#### Example: \n\n#### Garbage Collection ( gc=N ): \n\n**Run GC Before Profiling:** Set (^) gc=1 to trigger a garbage collection cycle before capturing a \n\n#### heap profile. \n\n#### Example: \n\n**Duration Parameters (** (^) **seconds=N ):** \n\n#### Allocations, Block, Goroutine, Heap, Mutex, Threadcreate Profiles: \n\nseconds=N (^) returns a delta profile based on the given duration. # Collect heap profile go tool pprof [http://localhost:6060/debug/pprof/heap](http://localhost:6060/debug/pprof/heap) # Collect 30-second CPU profile go tool pprof [http://localhost:6060/debug/pprof/profile?seconds=](http://localhost:6060/debug/pprof/profile?seconds=) 30 # Collect goroutine profile with debug=2 go tool pprof [http://localhost:6060/debug/pprof/goroutine?debug=](http://localhost:6060/debug/pprof/goroutine?debug=) 2 # Generate text-based CPU profile go tool pprof -text cpu.profile go tool pprof [http://localhost:6060/debug/pprof/allocs?debug=](http://localhost:6060/debug/pprof/allocs?debug=) 1 go tool pprof [http://localhost:6060/debug/pprof/heap?gc=](http://localhost:6060/debug/pprof/heap?gc=) 1 Make this page better \n\n\n#### CPU Profile and Trace Profiles: \n\n#### seconds=N specifies the duration for which the CPU profile or trace should run. \n\n#### Example: \n\n### 2.4 Collect Without Go Installed \n\nIf your program hasn’t installed Go (you can check by running (^) go version ), follow these steps to \n\n#### download and save profiling data locally: \n\n#### 1. Download the Profile File Using wget^. \n\n#### 2. Transfer the Profile File to Your Local Machine Using scp^. \n\n#### NOTE: Replace <user> with your SSH username and <node_ip> with the IP address of your Kaia node. \n\n## 3. Memory Profiling \n\n#### As mentioned earlier, memory profiling refers to the heap information provided by go pprof. It can also be \n\n#### collected through writeMemProfile in the debug namespace offered by the Kaia node. \n\n#### Profiling memory is crucial for analyzing memory-related issues, such as memory leaks. To control the \n\n#### granularity of memory profiling, adjusting the MemProfileRate variable can be helpful in this process. \n\n#### This should be set as early as possible in your node’s execution (e.g., at the beginning of the main \n\n#### function). \n\n###### NOTE \n\n go tool pprof http://localhost:6060/debug/pprof/profile?seconds= 30 \n\n wget -O memory_profile http://localhost:6060/debug/pprof/heap \n\n scp <user>@<node_ip>:memory_profile memory_profile \n\n # Using go tool pprof > go tool pprof http://localhost:6060/debug/pprof/heap # Using Node Console > debug.writeMemProfile(\"mem.profile\") \n\n\nKaia provides the (^) --memprofilerate flag which can set the (^) MemProfileRate variable easily. \n\n#### Therefore, since it is only available as a flag, it must be set when starting the node, and cannot be \n\n#### changed via the API call. \n\n**Set** (^) **MemProfileRate :** \n\n#### Profile Maximum Allocations: Set to 1. \n\n#### Disable Profiling: Set to 0. \n\n#### Default Setting:^512 *^1024 (profiles approximately one allocation per 512KB). \n\n#### Impact: \n\n**Higher Profiling Rate (Lower** (^) **MemProfileRate ):** Increases the granularity but may introduce \n\n#### performance overhead. \n\n#### Lower Profiling Rate (Higher MemProfileRate ): Reduces profiling detail, minimizing performance \n\n#### impact. \n\n#### Best Practice: \n\n#### Consistency: Ensure that MemProfileRate remains constant throughout the node’s runtime to \n\n#### maintain accurate profiling data. \n\n#### Early Configuration: Set MemProfileRate at the very start of the program to capture consistent \n\n#### profiling information \n\n## 4. Analyzing Profiles \n\nAfter collecting profiling data, use (^) go tool pprof to analyze and visualize the saved profile files. \n\n### 4.1 Analyze Using Web Interface \n\n#### For example, you can analyze memory profile data visually using Go’s pprof tool, which provides a visual \n\n#### representation of memory usage through a web interface as shown below: \n\n### 4.2 Analyze Using Command Line \n\n var MemProfileRate int = 512 * 1024 \n\n go tool pprof -http=0.0.0.0:8081 cpu.profile \n\n\n#### You can also analyze memory profile data using Go’s pprof tool in a text-based interface within the \n\n#### terminal: \n\n#### Common pprof Commands: \n\n#### top : Display the top functions consuming resources. \n\n#### list <function_name> : Show annotated source code for a specific function. \n\n#### web : Generate a visualization of the profile in your web browser. \n\npdf (^) : Generate a PDF report of the profile. \n\n#### Example Usage: \n\n###### NOTE \n\nEnsure you have Graphviz installed for the (^) web and (^) pdf commands to generate visual graphs. \n\n## 5. Conclusion \n\n#### By following this profiling tutorial, Kaia node operators can effectively identify and address performance \n\n#### bottlenecks, optimize resource usage, and ensure the smooth and efficient operation of their nodes. \n\n#### Regular profiling, combined with robust monitoring and logging practices, will contribute significantly to \n\n#### maintaining the reliability and performance of your Kaia node within the blockchain network. \n\n#### Edit this page \n\nLast updated on **Jan 24, 2025** \n\n#### Is this page helpful? \n\n go tool pprof cpu.profile \n\n go tool pprof cpu.profile # Inside the pprof interactive shell: > top > list main.functionName > web \n\n\n",
    " Node Quick Reference Prune Node Data \n\n# Prune Node Data \n\n#### This page explains how to delete historical block states to reduce the storage requirement. Kaia offers \n\n#### two approaches for pruning block states: \n\n#### Live Pruning: With the live pruning feature enabled, the block states beyond a certain retention \n\n#### period will be automatically deleted. \n\n#### Batch Pruning: State Migration: The block states can be state-migrated, meaning the block states \n\n#### before a certain block number become available. \n\n## Understanding Pruning Impacts \n\n#### \"Live pruning\" continuously deletes old states, keeping disk size at a minimum. However, due to \n\n#### accompanying bookkeeping tasks, live pruning slightly slows down block sync speed. \"Batch pruning\", on \n\n#### the other hand, does not affect performance after migration is complete, but a migration session takes a \n\n#### few days and temporarily requires large free disk space to copy the states. \n\n## How to Perform Live Pruning \n\nTo enable live pruning from the genesis block, use the (^) --state.live-pruning flag when starting your \n\n#### node. If you’re starting from a database where live pruning is already enabled, the flag is optional but \n\n#### recommended for clarity. \n\n##### NOTE \n\n#### You can control the retention period for live pruning using the --state.live-pruning\n\n#### retention NNN flag (default: 172800 seconds, that is 48 hours). This flag determines how long \n\n#### historical block states are kept before being pruned. \n\n##### INFO \n\n#### Databases with and without live pruning are incompatible. To run a node with live pruning, you must \n\n#### either start from the genesis block with the --state.live-pruning flag or start from a chaindata \n\n#### snapshot that already has live pruning enabled. \n\n#### You cannot convert a non-live-pruning database to a live-pruning database, and vice versa. Here \n\n#### are some example log messages you might see: \n\n\n## How to Perform Batch Pruning \n\n### Prerequisites \n\n#### Recommended to run on a machine with m6i.8xlarge (32 cores and 128GB memory) or higher specs. \n\n#### The machine should have enough spare disk space (500GB or more). \n\n#### The entire process takes approximately 7 days to complete: \n\n#### Stage 1: Copy (migrate) the state to a new directory. The message \"State migration is \n\n#### completed\" appears. \n\n#### Stage 2: Block sync continues on the new directory. The old directory will be deleted after this \n\n#### step. \n\n### Steps \n\n#### 1. Attach to the node via console: \n\n#### 2. Use the admin namespace RPCs to control state migration: \n\n # First time enabling live pruning with an empty database INFO[08/27,14:09:01 +09] [41] Writing live pruning flag to database \n\n # Live pruning enabled INFO[08/27,14:09:01 +09] [41] Live pruning is enabled retention=172800 \n\n # Live pruning disabled INFO[08/27,14:09:46 +09] [41] Live pruning is disabled because flag not stored in dat \n\n # Cannot turn on live pruning after the chain has advanced (head block num > 0) Fatal: Error starting protocol stack: cannot enable live pruning after chain has adva \n\n ken attach --datadir /var/kend/data \n\n // Start > admin.startStateMigration() null \n\n // Check progress > admin.stateMigrationStatus \n\n // Abort > admin.stopStateMigration() \n\n\n#### Edit this page \n\nLast updated on **Jan 24, 2025** \n\n#### Is this page helpful? \n\n\n",

    " Public JSON RPC Endpoints \n\n# Public JSON RPC Endpoints \n\nPublicly exposed JSON-RPC endpoints allow you to test and run your blockchain products by providing interaction with the Kaia network without running your own node. \n\nRunning your own Kaia Endpoint Node (EN) is not simple, it requires technical expertise, monitoring and computing resources. It comes with a cost of maintaining storage, network bandwidth as well as having to divert engineering time and resources; nodes must be kept up to date and health checked regularly. \n\nHence, the main benefit of using an existing Public EN is that it allows you to solely focus on building and testing your blockchain product without the distraction of maintaining infrastructure to connect and interact with the Kaia network. \n\n## Things to Consider \n\n The node providers are not responsible for any damage or losses caused in relation to traffic or interaction with the nodes. If traffic is concentrated on certain nodes, you may experience service delay. To prevent too many requests, rate limits may apply on a per-node basis, which are subject to change without prior notification. \n\n## Public JSON-RPC Endpoints \n\nBelow is the list of the network domains offered by Kaia’s Public Node Providers. \n\n OUTDATED ENDPOINTS STOPPED WORKING Please note that the following URLs was discontinued at the end of September 2024.

    " Advanced Topics Scaling Solutions \n\n# Scaling Solutions \n\nKaia offers robust scaling solutions to ensure high throughput and responsiveness even under heavy network load. These solutions include Service Chains and a novel Multi-Channel communication architecture \n\n## Service Chain \n\nService chains in Kaia are auxiliary blockchains independent from the Kaia main chain, tailored for individual dApp requiring special node configurations, customized security levels, or exceptionally high throughput that makes deploying the dApp on the main chain inconvenient or economically infeasible. \n\nWhile there are fully-decentralized scaling solutions, due to their difficult interfaces such as challenge or exit and non-immediate finality, we take a different approach in Kaia’s Service Chain by sacrificing the full decentralization for better usability, instant finality, high performance, and high availability. \n\nKaia service chains may be used for various service-specific goals, and can connect to the main chain for multiple reasons including data anchoring (periodic storing of block hashes from the service chain onto the main chain to compensate for the decreased security of the service chain due to the smaller number of nodes) or value transfer (interchain transfer of KAIA, Kaia’s native unit of value, and the tokens issued by dApps). \n\n## Network \n\nService chains connected to Kaia main chain are collectively called Service Chain Network. Note that the method of connection between service chains and the main chain may change in Kaia’s future iterations. \n\n Make this page better \n\n\nFigure 1 shows the network topology of service chains being used to meet various business needs, connected with Kaia main chain to expand the Kaia network. \n\nFigure 2 shows an example of SCN (Service Chain Consensus Node) connected directly with Kaia main chain’s EN (Endpoint Node) using a main/sub-bridge model in using the service chain’s features. \n\n**Features** (^) Make this page better \n\n\nService Chain expands and augments Kaia by providing a data integrity mechanism and supporting token transfers between different chains. \n\n### Data Anchoring \n\nFor data integrity, Service Chain can automatically anchor every service chain block hash as a special transaction to the main chain. This data anchoring can ensure to the service users that the data in the service chain cannot be altered once it is created. \n\n### Value Transfer \n\nTo help the service providers (SPs) to easily migrate service users and values across chains, transferring tokens, such as KAIA (Kaia’s native unit of value) and Kaia tokens issued by dApps, between different chains can be enabled. Users can easily request to transfer tokens to other chains by sending a transaction to a special contract, called bridge contract. \n\n## Multi-Channel Communication \n\nKaia employs a multi-channel communication architecture to enhance network performance and resilience, particularly during periods of high transaction volume. By separating different message types onto dedicated communication channels, Kaia can maintain efficient block propagation and consensus even under heavy network congestion. \n\n### Architecture \n\n Make this page better \n\n\nMulti-Channel Connection \n\nSingle-Channel Connection \n\n### Configuration Modes \n\n Multi-Channel: Uses two ports. Enabled by default in kend due to MULTICHANNEL=1 in kend.conf. Disable by setting^ MULTICHANNEL=0. Customize ports using^ --port and^ --subport flags. Single-Channel: Uses one port (default 32323). Active when MULTICHANNEL^ is not set or set to 0. \n\n### How Multi-Channel Works \n\nMulti-channel separates different message types onto dedicated ports: \n\n Main Port: Handles block-related messages (requests/responses for hash, header, body, receipt) and consensus messages (Request, Preprepare, Prepare, Commit, RoundChange). The meaning of the messages can be found in PBFT. Subport: Handles transaction messages. \n\nThis separation enhances network stability: if one port fails, the other continues operating. For example, if the subport (typically congested during high traffic) fails, the main port maintains essential block and consensus operations. \n\n**Connection Establishment** (^) Make this page better \n\n\n Multi-Channel to Multi-Channel: Both ports are used. Other Cases (Multi-Channel to Single-Channel or Single-Channel to Single-Channel): A single port is used. \n\nIf a node attempts to connect without specifying a subport, it initially connects using a single port. During the handshake, if the peer is multi-channel, the connection is re-established using both ports. \n\n### Port Configuration (KNI) \n\nSee the KNI scheme for details. Default ports are 32323 (main) and 32324 (sub). \n\n### Integration with KNI \n\nMulti-channel integrates with KNI for node discovery and connection. KNI URLs allow specifying both main and subports. \n\n### Implementation Note \n\nKaia’s multi-channel implementation deviates slightly from the original specification. While the details of this deviation are beyond the scope of this document, the core principles of enhanced network communication and robustness remain central to Kaia’s operation. This information is primarily relevant for node operators and developers. \n\nIn summary, multi-channel enhances Kaia’s network by segregating message traffic, improving efficiency and resilience. While providing advanced configuration options for node operators, the system remains transparent to general users. \n\nEdit this page Last updated on **Jan 24, 2025** \n\n Is this page helpful? \n\n Make this page better \n\n\n",

    " Signed message standards \n\n# Signed message standards \n\n### Wallet private keys are primarily used to sign transactions, but the same key can also be used to sign \n\n### any application-specific messages. Users can use signed messages to cryptographically authorize \n\n### actions. These off-chain signatures can save gas and reduce transaction count on the blockchain. \n\n### There are various technical methods, or standards, for message signing. Sure, digital signature is a \n\n### fundamental function of ECDSA. Nevertheless, several standards were devised to separate message \n\n### signature from transaction signature and to improve interoperability between applications. Without \n\n### signature standards, message signing functions could sign arbitrary hashes so the user signs malicious \n\n### transaction hashes disguised as messages. To prevent this from happening, message signing standards \n\n### modify the message so the signature cannot be used for other purposes. \n\n### Different wallets and SDKs support varying range of those standards, so you should choose an \n\n### appropriate method suited for your application. \n\n## Signing raw message \n\n### Signing the message as-is is the simplest approach. Because this is risky for the reasons mentioned \n\n### above, it is rarely used today. \n\nAmong the ecosystem tools, MetaMask supports raw message signing via (^) eth_sign method after \n\n### explicit user consent. This feature is only maintained for backwards compatibility and must not be used \n\n### in new projects. It’s worth reading the article What is 'eth sign' and why is it a risk? \n\n## KIP-97 Klaytn Signed Message \n\nSome Kaia nodes and SDKs have been providing a way to prefix messages with (^) \"\\x19Klaytn Signed \n\n### Message:\\n\" + len(message) before signing them. For details, please refer to KIP-97. Having the \n\n### Klaytnprefix can mitigate signature replay across chains, but the prefix alone cannot fully prevent \n\n### replay attacks. Applications must employ replay protection mechanisms, including random challenges or \n\n### timestamps, to defend against replay attacks within an application. \n\n### KIP-97 signatures are supported by: \n\n window.ethereum.request({ method: \"eth_requestAccounts\" }) window.ethereum.request({ method: \"eth_sign\", params: [\"0xbC7d1aBe33E6EC19cA873A3042A4DCF \n\n(^) Make this page better \n\n\nKaia Wallet (^) klay_sign method \n\n### caver-js keyring.signMessage and utils.recover methods \n\n### caver-java AbstractKeyring.signMessage and Utils.recover methods \n\n### In Kaia nodes until v1.0.0, eth_sign , kaia_sign , personal_sign personal_ecRecover RPCs \n\n### In Kaia nodes of all versions, kaia_recoverFromMessage RPC \n\n### Kaia Wallet example: \n\n### RPC example: \n\n## EIP-191 Ethereum Signed Message \n\n### In Ethereum and several EVM chains, it is widely used practice to prefix the messages with \n\n### \"\\x19Ethereum Signed Message:\\n\" + len(message) before signing them.

    " Smart Contracts Solidity Smart Contract Language \n\n# Solidity Smart Contract \n\n# Language \n\nThis chapter describes only the high-level concepts, development processes, and examples written in Solidity because Solidity is already well documented on its official websites. For language specifications or implementations, please refer to the References below. The content of this chapter is based on various websites listed in the References. \n\n## Solidity and Kaia \n\nSolidity is a high-level, statically typed, contract-oriented language for implementing smart contracts on the Ethereum platform. Although Solidity was originally designed for Ethereum, it is general enough to write smart contracts; therefore, it can also be used for other blockchain platforms, such as Kaia. \n\nKaia is officially compatible with **London** Ethereum Virtual Machine (EVM) version. Backward compatibility is not guaranteed with other EVM versions on Kaia. Thus, it is highly recommended to compile Solidity code with the Istanbul target option. Please refer to how to set the EVM version of solc. \n\n NOTE v1.7.0 Protocol Upgrade incompatible changes including Istanbul hard fork items and Kaia’s own items. It has been enabled from block number #75,373,312 in case of Kairos network and #86,816,005 for the Mainnet. \n\n v1.7.3 Protocol Upgrade incompatible changes including Base Fee from the London hard fork. It has been enabled from block number #80,295,291 in case of Kairos network and #86,816,005 for the Mainnet. \n\n v1.8.0 Protocol Upgrade incompatible changes including Base Fee from the London hard fork. It has been enabled from block number #86,513,895 in case of Kairos network and #86,816,005 for the Mainnet. \n\nDevelopment tools such as Remix (a browser-based IDE) and Truffle (a development framework) can be utilized when developing smart contracts for Kaia. The Kaia team will attempt to maintain compatibility between Ethereum’s development tools and Kaia’s but may elect to provide the Kaia smart contract developers with enhanced or updated versions of those tools when necessary. \n\n\nIt is convenient to utilize Remix or Truffle to develop smart contracts, but the Solidity compiler can be used locally, by building or installing it by following the instructions described in the web page below: \n\n Installing the Solidity Compiler \n\nNote that there are two command-line Solidity compilers: \n\n solc: the full-featured compiler Covered in the Solidity documentation solcjs: Javascript binding for solc Maintained as a separate project solc-js solcjs’s command-line options are not compatible with those of solc. \n\nOther materials that are useful for getting started with Solidity include the following: \n\n Top Solidity tutorials \n\n## How to Write a Smart Contract \n\nThis section presents an example of Solidity source code to provide readers with an idea of how smart contracts look and how to write a contract. Note that the code included here is provided solely for explanatory purposes; it is not intended for production purposes. In the code, (require) means that the line is required for any Solidity source file while (optional) indicates that the line is not always needed. The symbol Ln: is not part of the Solidity code and is included here only to show the line numbers. Please do not include these symbols in source code intended for real use. \n\n L01: pragma solidity 0.5.12; // (required) version pragma L02: L03: import \"filename\"; // (optional) importing other source files L04: L05: // (optional) smart contract definition L06: contract UserStorage { L07: mapping(address => uint) userData; // state variable L08: L09: function set(uint x) public { L10: userData[msg.sender] = x; L11: } L12: L13: function get() public view returns (uint) { L14: return userData[msg.sender]; L15: } L16: L17: function getUserData(address user) public view returns (uint) { L18: return userData[user]; L19: } L20: } \n\n\nThe above code should be self-explanatory; thus people familiar with any other programming language can skip the following explanation in this section and jump to the next section. However, for those who do not gain a clear understanding of what the code does or those for whom Solidity is a first programming language, we include a short description of the source code below: \n\n The portions of the code starting with a double forward slash ( // ) are comments rather than code; they are used to annotate and explain the code. The compiler ignores comments. The pragma statement in L01 indicates the minimum compiler version. The import statement in L03 imports all global symbols from \" filename \". The filename should be an actual file name. L05 -^ L20 define a smart contract called^ UserStorage. The keyword^ contract is located before the contract name and declares that the code represents a smart contract. Contracts in Solidity are similar to classes in object-oriented languages. Each contract can contain declarations for state variables, functions, function modifiers, events, struct types and enum types. Furthermore, contracts can inherit from other contracts. The example code contains one contract definition, but a single Solidity file may contain more than one contract definition. In L07 , userData is a state variable for the mapping type. State variables are permanently stored in contract storage. The state variable userData maintains a mapping between address and a uint value. The address type holds a 20-byte address (Kaia uses a 20-byte address similar to Ethereum). L09 defines a public function set that saves the value x in userData for the message’s sender. The variable msg.sender is a special variable defined in Solidity that represents the address of the message ( i.e., current call) sender. The keyword public means that the function is part of the contract interface and can be called externally or internally. The functions get in L13 and getUserData in L17 are declared with view , which means that the functions promise not to modify any state variable. Their declarations include returns (uint) , which implies that they return a uint value. \n\nFor more information concerning the syntax and semantics of the Solidity language, please refer to the Solidity documentation. \n\n## How to Compile, Deploy, and Execute \n\nOne way to compile Solidity code is to use the command-line compiler solc. This compiler can produce various outputs, ranging from simple binaries and assembly to an abstract syntax tree (parse tree). Assuming that the code above is saved in UserStorage.sol ( L03 is excluded in the source file shown above), some examples of compiling the file UserStorage.sol are as follows. \n\n $ solc --bin UserStorage.sol \n\n\n This command will print the compilation output as a binary, i.e., bytecode. \n\n The compiler generates a binary (by --bin ), an abstract syntax tree (by --ast ), and assembly code (by --asm^ ) as separate files in the output^ directory. \n\n For better performance, the optimizer can be activated during compilation using the --optimize flag. \n\nSome resources for compiling, deploying, and executing smart contracts are listed below. \n\n Using the Solidity command-line compiler Compiling contracts using Remix Running transactions with Remix Remix Learneth Tutorials Compiling contracts with Truffle Deploying contracts with Truffle \n\nNOTE: This section will be updated in the future. \n\n## Debugging Smart Contracts \n\nIt is more difficult to debug Solidity code than to debug code written in other programming languages due to the lack of mature debugging tools. Below, we list some resources for Solidity debugging. \n\n Debugging a transaction with Remix Tutorial on debugging transactions with Remix Debugging contracts with Truffle \n\nNOTE: This section will be updated in the future. \n\n## Smart Contract Best Practices \n\nTo eliminate security concerns and code quality issues from your smart contract, it is important to study and follow best practices in Solidity programming. Here, we show a reference for Solidity best practices. \n\n solc -o output --bin --ast --asm UserStorage.sol \n\n solc --optimize --bin UserStorage.sol \n\n\n Smart Contract Security Best Practices \n\nNOTE: This section will be updated in the future. \n\n## References \n\n Solidity GitHub page Solidity documentation Remix documentation Truffle documentation \n\nEdit this page Last updated on **Jan 24, 2025** \n\n Is this page helpful? \n\n\n",

    " Advanced Topics Data Management Storage Optimization \n\n# Storage Optimization \n\nAs the Kaia blockchain grows, so does the storage required to store the chain data. Kaia implements two main techniques to manage this growing storage requirement: \n\n## State Batch Pruning (State Migration) \n\nState Migration is a batch pruning feature that can be applied to existing node without interrupting the running node. \n\n## Motivation \n\nBlock states, or StateDB stores on-chain accounts and contracts in a trie data structure. The trie data structure is designed to store both obsolete and recent states so they can be verified using the Merkle hash. As transactions perform state changes, the state trie grows indefinitely. As of writing (Aug 2024), the Kaia Mainnet archive node size is over 20TB and even full node is over 10TB. \n\n## Concept \n\nState Migration deletes old block states that are not required for processing new blocks. It copies the state trie from \"old\" to \"new\". Not all trie nodes are copied. The ones are reachable from state roots of selective blocks are copied. After the copying, old directory is deleted so you are only left with the states of the selected blocks. \n\nRead these blog articles for more technical details: State Migration: Saving Node Storage, Kaia State Migration: An Efficient Way to Reduce Blockchain Data \n\nFor how to perform Batch Pruning, see the State Migration Guide. \n\n## State Live Pruning \n\nState Live Pruning is a new solution to the growing state database size problem. Unlike Batch Pruning (State Migration), Live Pruning automatically deletes old states little by little as the node process blocks. \n\n## Motivation \n\n Make this page better \n\n\nBlock states, or StateDB stores on-chain accounts and contracts in a trie data structure. The trie data structure is designed to store both obsolete and recent states so they can be verified using the Merkle hash. As transactions perform state changes, the state trie grows indefinitely. As of writing (Aug 2024), the Kaia Mainnet archive node size is over 20TB and even full node is over 10TB. \n\nPreviously the State Migration has mitigated this problem by deleting old states by selectively copying the recent states and deleting the rest. This can reduce the full node size to less than 5TB. \n\nNonetheless, the State Migration has its own drawbacks. It suffers from from high overhead of traversing the entire state trie which could take a few days. Also the state migration has to be manually triggered. To overcome these limitations, Live Pruning technique was introduced. \n\n## Concept \n\nTrie pruning is hard because it is uncertain if a trie node is outdated or not. In the original state trie structure, a trie node can be part of multiple tries each constitutes a different block. Even if a trie node (e.g. account balance) is updated to another value, the trie node cannot be deleted because it could be still needed by other parent nodes. This issue is referred to as the hash duplication problem. \n\nThe Live Pruning intentionally duplicates the trie nodes with the same content. Under Live Pruning, a trie node is not referenced by its hash, instead it is referenced by its ExtHash. An ExtHash is the 32-byte hash of the content plus a 7-byte serial index. The serial index is monotonically increasing, so that every trie node is unique. \n\nThis way, whenever a trie node’s content change, it is safe to assume that the trie node is now obsolete. The Merkle hash can be calculated the same way by just ignoring the serial index, make it compatible with non-live-pruning nodes in terms of consensus. \n\nRead this blog article for more technical details: Efficient Management of Blockchain Data Capacity with StateDB Live Pruning. \n\nFor how to enable Live Pruning, see the Live Pruning Guide. \n\nEdit this page Last updated on **Jan 24, 2025** \n\n Is this page helpful? \n\n Hash: 32-byte Keccak256 ExtHash: 32-byte Keccak256 + 7-byte Serial index \n\n Make this page better \n\n\n",

Let’s get started! \n\n Make this page better \n\n\n### Step 1: Create The S-Value Interface \n\n#### This creates the interface that will be used to fetch prices from SupraOracles. Add the following code to \n\n#### the solidity smart contract that you wish to retrieve an S-Value. \n\n### Step 2: Configure The S-Value Feed Address \n\n#### To fetch the S-Value from a SupraOracles smart contract, first find the S-Value Feed Address for the \n\n#### chain of your choice. When you have the right address, create an instance of the S-Value Feed using the \n\n#### interface we previously defined as such: \n\n#### In this example, we are implementing the S-Value Feed on the Kaia Kairos TestNet. You can verify the \n\n#### Kaia Kairos S-Value Feed Address here. \n\n### Step 3: Get The S-Value Crypto Price \n\n#### Now you can simply access the S-Value Crypto Price of our supported market pairs. In this step, you’ll \n\n#### get the price of ETH/USDT (eth_usdt) by applying the following code to your Smart Contract. \n\n## Practical implementation \n\n#### In the example below, we will be deploying the S-Value Price Feed Contract and also executing the \n\n#### getEthUsdtPrice() function to get the price ETH/USDT pairs. \n\n interface ISupraSValueFeed { function checkPrice( string memory marketPair ) external view returns ( int256 price , uint25 } \n\n contract ISupraSValueFeedExample { ISupraSValueFeed internal sValueFeed; constructor() { sValueFeed = ISupraSValueFeed(0x7f003178060af3904b8b70fEa066AEE28e85043E); } } \n\n function getEthUsdtPrice() external view returns ( int ) { ( int price, /* uint timestamp */ ) = sValueFeed.checkPrice(\"eth_usdt\"); return price; } \n\n(^) Make this page better \n\n\n### Create and Deploy Sample Code \n\n#### Remix IDE \n\n#### Navigate to Remix IDE \n\n#### Click on File Explorer tab, create a new file named demoSupraPriceFeed.sol^ in the contracts \n\n#### folder \n\n#### Paste the code below in your newly created file \n\n#### In Remix, click Compile contract. \n\n#### Click the Kaia tab on your left having installed the plugin \n\n#### Select Environment > Injected Provider Kaia Wallet. \n\n#### In Contract , select your contract.

    " Tools Indexers The Graph \n\n# The Graph \n\n#### Getting historical data on a smart contract can be frustrating when building a dapp. The Graph provides \n\n#### an easy way to query smart contract data through APIs known as subgraphs. The Graph’s infrastructure \n\n#### relies on a decentralized network of indexers, enabling your dapp to become truly decentralized. \n\n#### Both Kaia Mainnet & Testnet are supported by The Graph. \n\n## Quick Start \n\n#### These subgraphs only take a few minutes to set up. To get started, follow these three steps: \n\n#### 1. Initialize your subgraph project \n\n#### 2. Deploy & Publish \n\n#### 3. Query from your dapp \n\n#### Pricing: \n\n#### The rate-limited test endpoints in Studio are free. \n\n#### API calls for the decentralized network are pay-per-use at $4 per 100K queries. The first 100K \n\n#### queries are free! \n\n#### Here’s a step by step walk through: \n\n## 1. Initialize your subgraph project \n\n## Create a subgraph on Subgraph Studio \n\n#### Go to the Subgraph Studio and connect your wallet. Once your wallet is connected, you can begin by \n\n#### clicking “Create a Subgraph”. When choosing a name, it is recommended to use Title Case: “Subgraph \n\n#### Name Chain Name.” \n\n\n#### You will then land on your subgraph’s page. All the CLI commands you need will be visible on the right \n\n#### side of the page: \n\n\n### Install the Graph CLI \n\n#### On your local machine run the following: \n\n### Initialize your Subgraph \n\n#### You can copy this directly from your subgraph page to include your specific subgraph slug: \n\n#### You’ll be prompted to provide some info on your subgraph like this: \n\n npm install -g @graphprotocol/graph-cli \n\n graph init --studio <SUBGRAPH_SLUG> \n\n\n#### After entering the contract info, the graph-cli will attempt to fetch ABI, StartBLock & Contract name from \n\n#### the blockexplorer API. \n\n#### However, KaiaScan’s API is not ready yet, so when asked to retry, just say \"no\". Here’s how to obtain these \n\n#### manually: \n\n#### 1. ABI: You need to prepare a json file containing the ABI in the same directory where you’re running \n\n#### graph init. From the^ contract’s page on Kaiascan, go to the^ Contract tab, click^ View Code and \n\n#### you’ll be able to copy the ABI. Save it as a json file in the same folder where you’re running graph \n\n\n#### init. In this screenshot above, it was saved as^ abi.json. \n\n#### 2. Start Block: Click into the transaction hash where the contract was created. There you’ll find the \n\n#### block where the contract was created. \n\n\n#### 3. Contract Name: Just type in the name of the contract. If this is the only contract you’re indexing in \n\n#### this subgraph, it’s OK to just go with the default Contract. \n\n## 2. Deploy & Publish \n\n### Deploy to Subgraph Studio \n\n#### First run these commands: \n\n#### Then run these to authenticate and deploy your subgraph. You can copy these commands directly from \n\n#### your subgraph’s page in Studio to include your specific deploy key and subgraph slug: \n\n#### You will be asked for a version label.

    " Token Economics Token Economy \n\n# Token Economy \n\n## Overview \n\nKaia’s token economy is designed to create sustainable funding structures for empowering its ecosystem, growth initiatives, and strategic investments. Many public blockchain projects have monetary systems that solely incentivize their node operators (miners or block producers), focusing only on the technical aspect of network maintenance. However, such designs miss out on the importance of incentivizing other types of participants who contribute to the growth of the network’s token economy or invest in long-term growth prospects. In contrast, Kaia’s token economy is designed to compensate more diverse forms of contributions from a wider range of participants, and has built-in funding structure to procure sustained resources to fuel future growth initiatives and strategically sourced investment projects in addition to maintaining its blockchain nodes. \n\n## Funding Structure \n\nKaia’s funding structure runs continuously with Kaia network’s block generation. With every new block, newly issued KAIA and the sum of transaction fees used in the block (collectively called “block reward”) are aggregated and distributed to the following three destination accounts in accordance to the predetermined ratio: \n\n Validators and Community: 50% Block proposer rewards: 20% of the 50% (10% of total) Staking rewards: 80% of the 50% (40% of total) Kaia Ecosystem Fund (KEF): 25% Kaia Infrastructure Fund (KIF): 25% \n\n9.6 KAIA will be minted for every new block. This implies that approximately 300 million KAIA will be minted annually, which is equivalent to 5.2% annual inflation against the total KAIA tokens in the market (the annual inflation rate is subject to change through the Kaia Governance Process). Transaction fee is charged and metered according to the pre-determined fee tables. For detailed information about the transaction fees, please refer to Transaction Fees. \n\n## Kaia Governance Council Reward \n\nKaia Governance Council is the collective group of Core Cell Operators (CCOs). Council members are responsible for maintaining Core Cells (CCs), which makes the Council an essential body in the Kaia^ Make^ this^ page^ better \n\n\necosystem responsible for providing the underlying infrastructure. To become a Council member, the candidate must undergo a qualification review by the Kaia Governance Process and must stake at least 5 million KAIA. The Kaia Governance Council Reward is a structure for incentivizing Council members to continue to provide a stable foundation for the Kaia ecosystem. \n\n### Kaia Governance Council Reward Mechanism \n\nFor each block in the Kaia blockchain, a Committee is formed by randomly selecting members from the Kaia Governance Council (GC). This Committee consists of a single member who is assigned the role of Proposer, while the remaining Committee members take on the role of Validators. Once a block is successfully created and appended to the Kaia blockchain, the block reward is distributed among the Council members and various funds according to the previously mentioned ratios. \n\nAll Council members have an equal probability of being selected as the Proposer for a given block, and the block proposer reward is distributed evenly among them. However, the GC staking reward is allocated proportionally based on the amount of KAIA staked by each member, minus the minimum requirement of 5 million KAIA. This means that Council members who stake a larger amount of KAIA beyond the minimum threshold will receive a greater share of the staking reward compared to those who stake less. As a result, Council members are incentivized to stake more KAIA to maximize their potential rewards from the GC staking award portion of the block reward distribution. \n\nAs long as the minimum 5 million KAIA staking requirement is met, Kaia Governance Council members can freely stake or unstake his or her own KAIA. Staking information is updated every 86,400 blocks, and newly staked KAIA comes info effect two update cycles later from when the staking is completed. Withdrawing staked KAIA requires one week of delay to prevent malicious members from immediately exiting. \n\n### Penalty for Misbehaving Council Members \n\nA Council member may be subject to penalties for conducting misbehaviors defined below. In the future, more penalty rules can be established and refined through the Kaia Governance Process. \n\nCausing Safety Failure: \n\n A Council member selected as Proposer may not create more than one block in the same height A Council member selected as Proposer may not intentionally omit certain transactions \n\nCausing Liveness Failure: \n\n A Council member selected as Proposer must create a valid block A Council member selected as Validator must validate the block proposed by the Proposer \n\n Make this page better \n\n\n## Kaia Ecosystem Fund \n\nThe Kaia Ecosystem Fund (KEF) was established to support Kaia’s mission of enabling greater transparency and verifiability. It is funded by 25% of the total KAIA issued when creating a block. \n\nThe Kaia Ecosystem Fund will be used to fund activities that improve the Kaia ecosystem, such as: \n\n1. **Service Contribution Reward (SCR)** : The KEF will provide rewards to service developers or users     operating on the integrated ecosystem, as compensation for directly or indirectly contributing to     the enhancement of the ecosystem’s value. \n\n2. **Building our Developer Community** : The KEF will support various initiatives including hackathons,     development education programs, collaborative research with academia, and collaboration with     various DAOs to foster and grow the Kaia developer community. \n\n3. **Fostering Ecosystem Services and Infrastructure** : The KEF will support essential ecosystem     infrastructure, alongside the development of services with clear utility and provide marketing     support. \n\n4. **Kaia Eco Fund Indirect Investment** : The KEF will make indirect mid-to long-term investments by     entrusting specialized crypto VCs. A portion of the profits generated upon subsequent investment     recovery will be either burned or returned to the Kaia ecosystem. \n\n5. **Governance Committee Budget** : This budget is allocated for the operation of committees in     specific sectors such as Gaming, DeFi, and Community. These committees aim to grow the Kaia     Blockchain ecosystem in their respective sectors. \n\n6. **Other ecosystem and community-building activities** \n\nThe administration of the Kaia Ecosystem Fund follows a process in which the Governance Council (GC) reviews and approves the use of funds in public forums on Kaia Square. The Foundation will submit a quarterly budget proposal for each category to the GC for approval. Within the approved budget, each specific use will be reviewed and approved again by the GC. All execution details are transparently disclosed. \n\nNew proposals for the use of KEF can be made via the GC, requiring individual approval. Plans are in place to develop a structure allowing more ecosystem participants to efficiently propose and participate in KEF use. For categories requiring specialized and rapid decision-making, separate governance committees may operate. \n\n## Kaia Infrastructure Fund \n\nKaia Infrastructure Fund (KIF) is an operational fund that will focus on these main categories: \n\n1. **Mainnet and Essential Infrastructure R&D** : This includes advancing research on the latest     technologies related to mainnet and infrastructure, foundation-led service development, and     infrastructure establishment. \n\n Make this page better \n\n\n2. **Ecosystem Acceleration** : This includes token swap, financial support for small-scale Kaia     Blockchain ecosystem partners, attracting new GC members, and providing market liquidity. \n\n3. **Foundation Operations** : This includes operating expenses such as development, accounting, legal     affairs, IT infrastructure operations, marketing, and labor costs, as well as financial management     and fundraising costs. \n\nKIF is funded by 25% of the total KAIA issued when creating a block. It is executed by the foundation through an internal control system after a prior announcement of the budget plan for each detailed category. All execution details are transparently disclosed. \n\nThe foundation directly establishes a budget plan and executes the funds for KIF. To ensure transparent execution, the foundation discloses the budget plans and execution details in advance and afterward. \n\n## Treasury Rebalancing \n\nTo ensure the flexibility and adaptability of Kaia’s token economy, a Treasury Rebalance mechanism has been implemented. This process allows for adjustments to the treasury funds in response to changing ecosystem needs and market conditions. \n\n### Treasury Rebalance Contract \n\nThe Treasury Rebalance Contract is a smart contract designed to manage the rebalancing process in a transparent and secure manner. At its core, the contract operates as a finite state machine, progressing through stages such as initialization, registration, approval, and finalization. This structured approach ensures that all stakeholders have the opportunity to review and approve changes before they are implemented. \n\nKey features of this contract include: \n\n1. **Flexible Balance Adjustment** : The contract supports both increases and decreases in total fund     balance, enabling comprehensive treasury management. \n\n2. **Aligned Rebalance Timing** : The rebalance block number can be set to align with relevant hard fork     block numbers, providing better synchronization with network upgrades. \n\n3. **Transparent Execution** : The entire rebalancing process is recorded on the blockchain through the     TreasuryRebalance contract, maintaining the ecosystem’s commitment to openness and     verifiability. \n\n4. **Validator Consensus** : The rebalance event occurs only after reaching consensus among block     validators, ensuring network-wide agreement on the changes. \n\n5. **Immutable Record** : After execution, a detailed memo of the rebalance event is uploaded to the     contract, providing an immutable record of the changes for future reference and auditing.        Make this page better \n\n\nThis Treasury Rebalancing mechanism allows Kaia to maintain a dynamic and responsive token economy, better serving the evolving needs of its ecosystem while upholding principles of transparency and security. By leveraging smart contract technology and a consensus-based approach, it provides a structured and verifiable way to adjust treasury funds, ensuring that the Kaia blockchain can adapt to changing circumstances while maintaining the trust of its community. \n\nFor the information on the Treasury Rebalance contract addresses, please refer to KIP-160 and KIP-103. \n\nEdit this page Last updated on **Jan 24, 2025** \n\n Is this page helpful? \n\n Make this page better \n\n\n",

    " Core Concepts Transaction Fees \n\n# Transaction Fees \n\nThe transaction fee of one transaction is calculated as follows: \n\nAs an easy-to-understand analogy in this regard, suppose you’re filling up gas at a gas station. The gas price is determined by the refinery every day, and today’s price is $2. If you fill 15L up, then you would pay $30 = 15L x $2/1L for it, and the $30 will be paid out of your bank account. Also, the transaction will be recorded in the account book. \n\nTransaction fee works just the same as above. Suppose a transaction spent 21000 gas and the effective gas price of the transaction was 25 Gkei. Then the gas fee is 525000 Gkei. This amount would be deducted from the sender ( from^ account) balance. \n\n## Gas used \n\nEvery action that changes the state of the blockchain requires gas. While processing the transactions in a block, such as sending KAIA, using ERC-20 tokens, or executing a contract, the sender has to pay for the computation and storage usage. The payment amount is decided by the amount of gas^ required. The gas has no unit, and we just say like \"21000 gas\". \n\nGas of a transaction comprises of two components: \n\nIntrinsicGas (^) is the gas statically charged based on the transaction body itself, such as the size of the input. For more details, please refer to Intrinsic Gas. ExecutionGas is the gas dynamically calculated during the execution. For more details, please refer to Execution Gas. The gas used amount is only determined after the transaction is executed. As such, you can find the gas used amount of a transaction from its receipt. \n\n### Finding the appropriate gasLimit \n\nEvery transaction must specify a gasLimit which is the maximum gas the transaction can spend. The \n\nsender can also utilize the (^) eth_estimateGas and (^) kaia_estimateGas RPCs to find the appropriate gasLimit for a transaction. Alternatively, the sender can manually specify a big enough number. Specifying a high gasLimit does not automatically charge high gas fee, so using a fixed number is a gas fee := (gas used) x (effective gas price) Make this page better \n\n\nviable option. However, the sender having only a few tokens cannot specify too high gasLimit because the sender has to own at least gasLimit * effectiveGasPrice in its balance regardless of the actual gasUsed. \n\n## Effective gas price \n\nEffective gas price of a transaction is calculated from many variables: \n\n Hardfork level Gas price fields in the transaction submitted by the sender maxFeePerGas (often referred to as feeCap) field exists in the type 2 transactions. maxPriorityFeePerGas (often referred to as tipCap) field exists in the type 2 transactions. gasPrice field exists in every other transaction types. baseFeePerGas (often referred to as baseFee) of the block the transaction is executed in \n\n### Before Magma hardfork (fixed unit price) \n\nBefore Magma hardfork, the transaction fee of all transactions is the fixed value called (^) unitPrice. This unitPrice can be adjusted via governance. All transactions must submit the gas price field that equals to the current unitPrice. The unit price mechanism avoids UX frustration due to gas price estimation in the gas fee auction market and allows service providers to easily predict gas fee budget. The unitPrice at a given block can be found through the kaia_getParams API. \n\n### After Magma hardfork (KIP-71 dynamic base fee) \n\nSince Magma hardfork, the network decides a gas price value baseFeePerGas (or simply baseFee) every block depending on the network congestion. The baseFee increases if the transaction traffic is higher than a threshold, and decreases otherwise. The transaction traffic is measured in the block gas used. As transaction executions in a block gets heavier, the network perceives higher congestion, likely to increase the baseFee. \n\nUnlike EIP-1559, Magma gas policy has no tip (tip is introduced since Kaia hardfork). Instead, the FCFS (first-come first-serve) policy is implemented to protect the network from spamming. \n\n**baseFee calculation** \n\nThe baseFee calculation depends on following parameters: \n\n Block congestion data PREVIOUS_BASE_FEE: Base fee of the previous block PREVIOUS_BLOCK_GAS_USED: Gas used to process all transactions of the previous block^ Make^ this^ page^ better \n\n\n Tuning parameters which can be changed later via governance GAS_TARGET: The gas amount that determines the increase or decrease of the base fee MAX_BLOCK_GAS_USED_FOR_BASE_FEE: Implicit block gas limit to enforce the max basefee change rate. BASE_FEE_DENOMINATOR: The value to set the maximum base fee change per block UPPER_BOUND_BASE_FEE: The maximum value for the base fee LOWER_BOUND_BASE_FEE: The minimum value for the base fee \n\nBelow is an oversimplified version of the baseFee calculation. In its essense, the base fee change is proportional to the difference between GAS_TARGET and PREVIOUS_BLOCK_GAS_USED, and other parameters controls the change speed or bounds the baseFee. Refer to KIP-71 for the exact formula. \n\nThe tuning parameters at a given block can be found through the kaia_getParams^ API. The baseFeePerGas of each block can be found through the kaia_getBlock* and eth_getBlock* APIs. \n\n**Gas fee burn** \n\nSince Magma hardfork, half of the block gas fee is burnt. See KIP-71 for details. \n\nSince Kore hardfork, most of the block gas fee is burnt. See KIP-82 for details. \n\n### After Kaia hardfork (KIP-162 priority fee) \n\nSince Kaia hardfork, the transactions can specify nonzero priority fee (or simply tip) to increase the block inclusion possibility. The Kaia gas policy is similar to EIP-1559 in that transactions pay the baseFee plus the effective tip. \n\nThe effective gas price of a transaction is defined as min(baseFee + tipCap, feeCap). For type-2 transactions, the transaction fields maxPriorityFeePerGas and maxFeePerGas naturally becomes the tipCap and feeCap. However, other transaction types only have one gasPrice field. For those \n\ntypes, tipCap and feeCap are both equals to (^) gasPrice. Consequently their effective gas price becomes min(baseFee + tipCap, feeCap) = min(baseFee + gasPrice, gasPrice) = gasPrice , which is identical to gas price auction mechanism. See KIP-162 for details. min(PREVIOUS_BLOCK_GAS_USED, MAX_BLOCK_GAS_USED_FOR_BASE_FEE) GAS_TARGET changeRate = ---------------------------------------------------------------------------BASE_FEE_DENOMINATOR * GAS_TARGET nextBaseFeeBeforeBound = PREVIOUS_BASE_FEE * (1 + changeRate) nextBaseFee = max(min(nextBaseFeeBeforeBound, UPPER_BOUND_BASE_FEE), LOWER_BOUND_BASE_FEE Make this page better \n\n\n### Finding the appropriate gas price after Kaia \n\nIf your application or wallet utilizes type-2 transactions (EIP-1559 type), ensure you set a reasonable \n\npriority fee. You can also call the (^) eth_maxPriorityFeePerGas RPC to retrieve the recommended priority fee (tx.maxPriorityFeePerGas). When the network is uncongested, a zero priority fee transaction should have no disadvantage in transaction processing. When the network is congested it is safer to specify a nonzero priority fee to compete with other transactions. The Kaia node’s eth_maxPriorityFeePerGas^ RPC shall: Return 0 if the network is uncongested. The network is considered uncongested when the next baseFeePerGas equals the UPPER_BOUND_BASE_FEE. Otherwise return P percentile effective priority fees among the transactions in the last N blocks. Kaia nodes with default settings uses P=60 and N=20 but the configuration can differ by nodes. A type-2 transaction’s maxFeePerGas should be higher than the network’s next baseFee to ensure the transaction gets processed even if the baseFee rises. A common formula is lastBaseFee*2^ + maxPriorityFeePerGas. It takes at least 15 seconds for baseFee to double when BASE_FEE_DENOMINATOR is 20. Another option is to use (^) eth_gasPrice RPC. For transactions of other tx types, more care should be taken when choosing an appropriate (^) gasPrice. Because for these tx types, the gasPrice is spent as-is regardless of the baseFee. On the other hand, gasPrice must be at least network’s baseFee. Therefore, applications and users would want to avoid setting gasPrice too high, while at the same time matching the network’s baseFee. One strategy would be setting the gasPrice^ a slightly higher than the next baseFee so it can accommodate a few baseFee rises. You can call eth_gasPrice RPC to retrieve the recommended gas price. The Kaia node’s (^) eth_gasPrice RPC shall: Return (next baseFee) * M + (eth_maxPriorityFeePerGas). Multiplier M is heuristically chosen as 1.10 under uncongested network and 1.15 under congested network. When BASE_FEE_DENOMINATOR is 20, the M=1.10 can withstand at least one baseFee increase (1.05) and M=1.15 can withstand at least two consecutive baseFee increase (1.05*1.05). Considering that the baseFee usually does not rise at top speed of 5%, the multiplier should actually be enough for a few baseFee increases. \n\n### Gas price summary \n\n Make this page better \n\n\n Hardfork gasPrice requirement \n\n maxFeePerGas requirement \n\n maxPriorityFeePerGas requirement \n\n calculated effectiveGasPrice \n\n Before Magma \n\n must be unitPrice \n\n must be unitPrice (only after EthTxType fork) \n\n must be unitPrice (only after EthTxType fork) \n\n unitPrice \n\n After Magma \n\n at least baseFee (recommended: 2*baseFee) \n\n at least baseFee (recommended: 2*baseFee) \n\n ignored baseFee \n\n After Kaia \n\n at least baseFee (recommended: baseFee*M + suggestedTip) \n\n at least baseFee (recommended: baseFee*2 + suggestedTip) \n\n up to users, wallets, and SDKs (recommended: suggestedTip = 0 or P percentile in N blocks) \n\n tx type 2: min(baseFee + feeCap, tipCap), other tx types: gasPrice \n\nEdit this page Last updated on **Jan 24, 2025** \n\n Is this page helpful? \n\n Make this page better \n\n\n",
    " Core Concepts Transactions \n\n# Transactions \n\nTransactions are the core mechanism for state changes on the Kaia blockchain. They represent messages passed between accounts, altering balances, deploying smart contracts, or executing contract functions. For example, when a transaction that sends 10 KAIA from Alice’s account to Bob’s is executed, Alice’s balance decreases by 10 KAIA, and Bob’s balance increases by 10 KAIA. Understanding transactions is fundamental to grasping how Kaia works. \n\n## Key Aspects of Kaia Transactions \n\n Atomic Operations: Each transaction is treated as a single, indivisible unit. Either the entire transaction succeeds, applying all changes, or it fails, leaving the blockchain state unchanged. This ensures data integrity and prevents partial updates. \n\n Components: Kaia transactions share core components with other blockchains but also have unique elements due to its decoupling of key pairs and addresses. This decoupling enhances flexibility but requires explicit sender information within the transaction. Typical components include: \n\n Sender: The originating account ( from field). This is explicitly included in Kaia transactions because addresses and key pairs are not directly linked. Recipient: The destination account ( to field, for value transfers and smart contract interactions). \n\n**Value:** The amount of KAIA being transferred ( (^) value field, in (^) kei ). **Data:** Additional information ( (^) input field), often used as input for smart contract execution. **Fees:** Calculated based on gas (maximum gas allowed) * gasPrice (price per unit of gas). Fees are paid in KAIA (unit: kei^ , see [link to KAIA units documentation]). **Signature ( v , r , s fields):** Cryptographic proof authorizing the transaction. **Transaction Types:** Kaia offers a variety of transaction types to support different use cases, from basic value transfers to complex smart contract interactions and fee delegation. This flexibility caters to diverse needs and optimizes performance. See the Implementing Transactions page for details on each type. **Fee Mechanism:** Transactions require fees to incentivize validators. These fees are calculated based on the computational resources consumed ( (^) gas ) and a price per unit of gas ( (^) gasPrice ), which can be dynamic. Make this page better \n\n\n Security: Transactions are cryptographically signed, ensuring authenticity and preventing unauthorized modifications. Kaia’s decoupling of key pairs and addresses adds another layer of security. \n\n Fee Delegation: Kaia’s fee delegation feature allows third parties to pay transaction fees on behalf of users, simplifying user onboarding and supporting various business models.

    " Service Chain Configure Service Chain Transfer Value \n\n# Transfer Value \n\n#### As explained in the Kaia design section, Service Chain supports value (KAIA, ERC-20, and ERC-721) \n\n#### transfer between parent chain & child chain. This page shows how to enable the value-transfer feature \n\n#### in SCN. \n\n#### After setting up the EN and SCN, the following procedure is required to enable value-transfer between \n\n#### chains. \n\n#### 1. Check the addresses of the bridge operator accounts and add KAIA to the bridge operator \n\n#### accounts. \n\n#### 2. Deploy the bridge contract to the parent/child chains. \n\n#### 3. Deploy a token (ERC-20 or 721) contract to the parent/child chains. (If you just need KAIA-transfer, \n\n#### you can skip step 3 & 4.) \n\n#### 4. Register the token contracts with the bridge contracts on the parent/child chains. \n\n#### 5. Subscribe to the bridge contracts on the parent/child chains. \n\n#### Before we follow the steps, let’s take a look at the high-level system architecture to understand the \n\n#### behind of the mechanism. \n\n## System Architecture \n\n#### Figure 1 shows the system architecture of the Service Chain with bridge/token contracts and bridge \n\n#### nodes. \n\n#### Below contracts communicate with each other via main/sub-bridge to process user’s value transfer \n\n#### requests. \n\n#### Bridge contract \n\n#### ERC-20 contract (if needed) \n\n#### ERC-721 contract (if needed) \n\n Make this page better \n\n\n## Bridge Operator Account \n\n#### For ServiceChain, there are two operator accounts: parent chain bridge operator account, service chain \n\n#### bridge operator account. Each operator account is used to sign transactions. If the transaction moves \n\n#### the value to the parent chain, the parent chain bridge operator account signs the transaction. To the \n\n#### child chain, the child chain bridge operator account is used. If a user submits a \"request value transfer\" \n\n#### transaction, the Sub-bridge creates a \"handle value transfer\" transaction signed by the bridge operator \n\n#### account. Therefore, the parent chain bridge operator needs enough KAIA in their balance to pay the \n\n#### transaction fee to the parent chain. If the service chain’s gas price is set to non-zero, the service chain \n\n#### bridge operator should have KAIA in their balance as well. \n\n### Keystore and Password file \n\n#### When SCN is booted, the keystore files and password files for the parent/child operators are \n\n#### automatically generated if their keys don’t exist. If you want to use a specific account as an operator, \n\n#### you can provide the key. Place the below files in the designated path before booting the SCN. The \n\n#### password file should have a password string of the keystore file. The password file name should be the \n\n#### account address of the corresponding keystore file. \n\n#### files \n\n#### keystore file : UTC--2019-10-21T04-05-41.493850000Z\n\n##### -2ed72a9d7fe5da7672fd21567e07302431649b0b \n\n#### password file : 0x2eD72a9D7fe5da7672fD21567e07302431649B0B \n\n#### file path \n\n#### Parent chain bridge operator : $datadir/parent_bridge_account \n\n Make this page better \n\n\n#### Child chain bridge operator : $datadir/child_bridge_account \n\n### Check Bridge Operator Addresses \n\n#### If you run SCN successfully, you can check the parent/child chain bridge operator address using RPC API \n\n#### like the following. \n\n#### You can refer to the subbridge API for more details. \n\n### Send KAIA to Bridge Operators \n\n#### Like anchoring, the parent chain bridge operator needs KAIA to make a value-transfer transaction. If the \n\n#### service chain’s gas price is set to non-zero, the service chain bridge operator should have KAIA in their \n\n#### balance as well. \n\n#### After topping up the operator accounts, you can check their balances like below. \n\n#### Parent chain bridge operator \n\n > pwd /$dataDIR/child_bridge_account \n\n > ls 0x2eD72a9D7fe5da7672fD21567e07302431649B0B UTC-2019 10 21T0405 41.493850000Z--2ed72a9d7fe5da7672fd21567e07302431649b0b \n\n > cat 0x2eD72a9D7fe5da7672fD21567e07302431649B0B %S~f5qqM38cB47jL% \n\n > cat UTC-2019 10 21T0405 41.493850000Z--2ed72a9d7fe5da7672fd21567e07302431649b0b {\"address\":\"2ed72a9d7fe5da7672fd21567e07302431649b0b\",\"crypto\":{\"cipher\":\"aes-128-ctr\",\"c \n\n $ kscn attach --datadir ~/kscnd_home Welcome to the Kaia JavaScript console! \n\n instance: Kaia/vvX.X.X/XXXX-XXXX/goX.X.X \n\n datadir: ~/kscnd_home modules: admin:1.0 subbridge:1.0 debug:1.0 governance:1.0 istanbul:1.0 klay:1.0 miner:1. \n\n > subbridge.parentOperator \"0xA057995175B93Ee0D1bdfA54f078Ad0F0116130b\" > subbridge.childOperator \"0x5C1C757a6Cb6c6FcEFE398674D8209FDA2A74Df4\" \n\n $ kscn attach --datadir ~/kscnd_home Welcome to the Kaia JavaScript console!^ Make^ this^ page^ better \n\n\n#### Child chain bridge operator \n\n## Bridge Contract \n\n#### For the cross-chain value transfer, a bridge contract should be deployed to the parent/child chains. \n\n#### Users can request a KAIA transfer to the bridge contract to send their KAIA to the other chain. \n\n#### Additionally, if token contracts are registered in the bridge contracts, bridge contracts can handle the \n\n#### token transfer between parent and child chains. \n\n### Deployment \n\n#### Sub-bridge provides a bridge contract deployment API.

Say you requested KAIA transfer from \n\n#### subbridge to mainbridge or from mainbridge to subbridge. In that case, the bridge contract on the \n\n#### receiver side must have enough KAIA than the requested amount of KAIA. If not, the transfer would fail \n\n#### without error notification in the return value. A feature of value transfer recovery finds unhandled events \n\n#### and insert them into event pool again in a given interval, which means the failed transaction can be \n\n#### succeed again when the counterpart bridge can successfully handle that event. In case of the above \n\n#### example, the failed transaction would be eventually handled by value transfer recovery when the \n\n#### counterpart bridge has enough KAIA. In order to set the value transfer recovery as default, you need to \n\n#### set two properties: \n\n#### The value transfer recovery runs automatically by set SC_VTRECOVERY=1. SC_VTRECOVERY_INTERVAL \n\n#### means an interval how often the value transfer recovery is executed. \n\n## Collecting Fee for KAIA/ERC-20 transfer \n\n#### In ServiceChain, there is a fee collecting feature for KAIA/ERC-20 transfers. \n\n#### To be updated soon. \n\n## Customizing your Bridge Contract \n\n#### In ServiceChain, you can use your own customized Bridge contract that inherits from the original Bridge \n\n#### contract for your own unique service.

    " Service Chain Quick Start Transfer value between sibling service chains \n\n# Transfer value between sibling \n\n# service chains \n\n### This section will explain how to enable value transfer between ServiceChain networks. The main \n\n### features provided by ServiceChain, data anchoring and value transfer, can be used independently. That \n\n### is, you can use only data anchoring or only value transfer, regardless of whether you use the other \n\n### feature. \n\n### As shown in the figure below, if there are two ServiceChains (chainID 1002 and 1004) connected to \n\n### Kairos, since each servicechain performs data anchoring with Kairos, data anchoring is not required \n\n### between each other, only value transfer is required. \n\n### To transfer value when there is no bridge between two ServiceChains, first transfer value from the \n\n### ServiceChain (chainID 1002) to kairos (chainID 1001), and then transfer value from kairos (chainID 1001) \n\n### to the ServiceChain (chainID 1004) again. This is inefficient than providing value transfer directly from \n\n### the ServiceChain (chainID 1002) to the ServiceChain (chainID 1004) at once. Therefore, by creating a \n\n### bridge between ServiceChains directly, we can transfer value efficiently. \n\n\n## Prerequisites \n\n### We assume that you installed two ServiceChains, Each servicechain is connected to the kairos EN. \n\n### Refer to Connecting to Kairos. \n\n### We also assume that you have experienced value transfer through Cross-Chain Value Transfer. \n\n### Repeat Connecting to Kairos as shown in the picture above to additionally install ServiceChain (chianID \n\n### 1004). \n\n### A node can have only one main-bridge and one sub-bridge each. In this example, for convenience of \n\n### explanation, we are going to connect a bridge to SCN-L2-03 and SCN-L2-07, which are nodes that do \n\n### not have both main-bridge and sub-bridge yet. \n\n\n## Step 1: Check KNI of SCN-L2-03 Node \n\n### Take note of SCN-L2-03’s KNI which is the information used to connect from an SCN node. This value will \n\nbe used in the next step when generating (^) main-bridges.json \n\n## Step 2: Create main-bridges.json \n\n### Log on to an SCN-L2-07 (note: chianID 1004) and create main-bridges.json on ~/data. Replace \n\n### [::] located after^ @ letter with EN node’s IP address. \n\n SCN-L2-03$ kscn attach --datadir ~/data > mainbridge.nodeInfo.kni \"kni://...39047242eb86278689...@[::]:50505?discport=0\" \n\n $ echo '[\"kni://...39047242eb86278689...@192.168.0.3:50505?discport=0\"]' > ~/data/main-br \n\n\n## Step 3: Configure SCN then Restart \n\nFrom the SCN-L2-07 node’s shell, edit (^) kscn-XXXXX-amd64/conf/kscnd.conf. Since each \n\n### ServiceChain already anchored with the Kairos EN, data anchoring between sibling is not required. So \n\n### we set SC_ANCHORING to 0. \n\n### Restart kscnd on SCN-L2-07 node \n\nCheck if the SCN-L2-07 is connected to the SCN-L2-03 by checking (^) subbridge.peers.length \n\n### In the case of value transfer, if the information corresponding to chainID 1002 is used as the mainbridge \n\n### information and the information corresponding to chainID 1004 is set as a subbridge, value transfer is \n\n### possible between siblings as in Cross-Chain Value Transfer. \n\n### Edit this page \n\nLast updated on **Jan 24, 2025** \n\n### Is this page helpful? \n\n#### ... \n\n#### SC_SUB_BRIDGE=1 \n\n#### ... \n\n#### SC_PARENT_CHAIN_ID=1002 \n\n#### ... \n\n#### SC_ANCHORING=0 \n\n#### ... \n\n SCN-L2-07$ kscnd stop Shutting down kscnd: Killed SCN-L2-07$ kscnd start Starting kscnd: OK \n\n SCN-L2-07$ kscn attach --datadir ~/data > subbridge.peers.length 1 \n\n\n",
    " Transition to Kaia Transition FAQ \n\n# Transition FAQ \n\n ARCHIVE NOTICE Please note that most of the information provided in this FAQ reflects a transitional period that occurred in 2024, and most of the events and processes mentioned have already taken place. While the FAQ remains available for historical reference, some sections are now out of date and may no longer apply. For the most current information regarding Kaia, please consult the latest official documentation and announcements. \n\nThis FAQ addresses common questions and concerns for CEXs, node providers, wallet providers, dApp builders, and retail users familiar with the Klaytn ecosystem, to ensure a smooth transition. \n\n KLAY and FNSA holders \n\n What happened to Klaytn and Finschia? What happens to KLAY and FNSA? Will I need to create a new wallet for Kaia? Will Klaytn provide a swap or migration website for new KAIA tokens? Will there be any delay in receiving KAIA tokens? Is there a limit on the amount for swapping KLAY and FNSA tokens? I’m currently staking FNSA. Will I need to wait 7 days to unstake my FNSA to swap to KAIA? Where can I find the historical price information for KLAY and FNSA? I can’t seem to find it on CoinMarketCap or CoinGecko anymore. \n\n DApp builders \n\n What do DApps on Klaytn need to do to migrate to Kaia? What do DApps on Finschia need to do to migrate to Kaia? Will Kaia Foundation continue to provide code audit grants as Klaytn Foundation did? \n\n Wallet providers \n\n Is it necessary to update the brand name from Klaytn to Kaia in the wallet? What happens if we don’t upgrade to the Kaia brand after the mainnet upgrade? What will happen to Klaytnscope, the default explorer? \n\n Centralized exchanges Make this page better \n\n\n Is KAIA a rebrand from KLAY or a completely new token? Will Kaia be on the Klaytn mainnet or a different mainnet? Will the current Klaytn mainnet continue to work after the rebrand? When will the KAIA market open? Where can I find Kaia’s whitepaper? \n\n RPC node providers \n\n What changes do I need to make to my infrastructure to support the transition from Klaytn to Kaia, and will there be any breaking changes in the RPC APIs? Is Kaia a new chain with a different chain ID, or an upgrade based on the Klaytn chain? \n\n## KLAY and FNSA holders \n\n### What happened to Klaytn and Finschia? \n\nKlaytn and Finschia merged to form Kaia through governance decisions made by both chains. You can view the voting results here. The utility tokens of the two chains (KLAY and FNSA) are converted to the KAIA token. You can find the exchange rates for both tokens here. \n\n### What happens to KLAY and FNSA? \n\nWith the launch of the KAIA coin, KLAY balances were automatically reflected as KAIA. FNSA holders are able to use the swap service on the Kaia Portal to burn their FNSA tokens on the Finschia network and claim an equivalent value of KLAY tokens. Please read this post to learn more about swapping your FNSA to KAIA. \n\n### Will I need to create a new wallet for Kaia? \n\nYour Klaytn wallet will be usable on Kaia, but you will need to update the RPC and block explorer URLS if you are using a 3rd-party multi chain wallet such as Metamask. These will be provided at a later date. Finschia wallet holders will need to create a Kaia wallet, and a website will be provided for FNSA holders to burn their tokens and claim an equivalent value of KAIA. \n\n### Will Klaytn provide a swap or migration website for new KAIA tokens? \n\nNo action is required from users. KLAY tokens will be automatically renamed to KAIA tokens. \n\n**Will there be any delay in receiving KAIA tokens?** (^) Make this page better \n\n\nThe token swap will be delayed by at least 30 minutes Timelock for safety. Relayers and RPC nodes may incur insignificant additional delays \n\n### Is there a limit on the amount for swapping KLAY and FNSA tokens? \n\nThere is no limit for swapping and bridging the two tokens. \n\n### I'm currently staking FNSA. Will I need to wait 7 days to unstake my \n\n### FNSA to swap to KAIA? \n\nWith the upcoming launch of Kaia, a governance vote will be proposed on the Finschia network to smoothly integrate token and governance mechanisms, including potentially reducing the unbonding time from 7 days to a couple of hours. If the vote passes, FNSA holders will be able to unstake and swap without having to wait a week. \n\n### Where can I find the historical price information for KLAY and FNSA? \n\n### I can't seem to find it on CoinMarketCap or CoinGecko anymore. \n\nDue to the merger of KLAY and FNSA and their transition to the new token KAIA, historical price information for KLAY and FNSA is no longer available on cryptocurrency tracking websites. However, we have preserved this data for transparency and reference purposes. You can download CSV files containing the historical price data for both KLAY and FNSA from Kaia native coin KAIA. \n\n## DApp builders \n\n### What do DApps on Klaytn need to do to migrate to Kaia? \n\nKlaytn apps will work seamlessly with the Kaia chain, requiring only rebranding. The team will provide branding guidelines. For existing Finschia apps, tech updates and marketing support will be provided through their business channels. \n\n### What do DApps on Finschia need to do to migrate to Kaia? \n\nFor DApps in the Finschia ecosystem to migrate to Kaia, a process similar to migrating from a Cosmwasm chain to an EVM chain is required. Additional migration support will be shared once available, but if you need immediate assistance please contact Finschia Foundation. \n\n### Will Kaia Foundation continue to provide code audit grants as Klaytn \n\n### Foundation did? Make^ this^ page^ better \n\n\nYes, audit grants will remain the same along with other grant and funding programs available for Klaytn. \n\n## Wallet providers \n\n### Is it necessary to update the brand name from Klaytn to Kaia in the \n\n### wallet? \n\nYes, eco-partners will be informed when the update is required. \n\n### What happens if we don't upgrade to the Kaia brand after the \n\n### mainnet upgrade? \n\nThere will be no functional issues after the mainnet upgrade. Rebranding can be done later. \n\n### What will happen to Klaytnscope, the default explorer? \n\nKlaytnscope will continue to work as before and will be upgraded after three months. \n\n## Centralized exchanges \n\n### Is KAIA a rebrand from KLAY or a completely new token? \n\nKAIA is a rebrand of KLAY. KLAY will continue to be used with the updated name and ticker symbol. It is recommended to renew the token chart if possible. \n\nDue to the merger of the Klaytn and Finschia chains, the total and circulating supply have changed. The circulating supply increased from approximately 3.804 billion to 5.805 billion KAIA, while the total supply decreased from approximately 6.005 billion to 5.805 billion KAIA. These figures may not reflect the current circulating and total supply due to ongoing inflation. KAIA’s inflation rate has been adjusted from 6.4 KAIA per block to 9.6 KAIA per block. For more details on these changes, please refer to the KAIA Issuance and Distribution Plan. \n\n### Will Kaia be on the Klaytn mainnet or a different mainnet? \n\nKaia will continue to be on the Klaytn mainnet. \n\n### Will the current Klaytn mainnet continue to work after the rebrand? \n\n Make this page better \n\n\nYes, the mainnet’s operation will remain unaffected. The transition to Kaia primarily involves a name change and technical upgrades occurring behind the scenes. \n\n### When will the KAIA market open? \n\nThe KAIA market will open in Q3 2024, we will share the exact block number closer to the date. \n\n### Where can I find Kaia’s whitepaper? \n\nYou can access Kaia’s whitepaper here. \n\n## RPC node providers \n\n### What changes do I need to make to my infrastructure to support the \n\n### transition from Klaytn to Kaia, and will there be any breaking changes \n\n### in the RPC APIs? \n\nMost RPC APIs will remain the same on the Kaia chain, with the exception of namespace changes from klay_ to kaia_. However, klay_ will still be available for backward compatibility. \n\nTo support the transition from Klaytn to Kaia, RPC node providers will need to upgrade their binary to the Kaia version once it is released. No immediate action is required before the upgrade. \n\n### Is Kaia a new chain with a different chain ID, or an upgrade based on \n\n### the Klaytn chain? \n\nKaia is a hard fork of the Klaytn chain, and the chain ID remains unchanged. The previous testnet \"Baobab\" has been renamed to \"Kairos,\" while the mainnet \"Cypress\" is now referred to as \"Mainnet\" or \"Kaia Mainnet.\" The original URLs related to Klaytn such as docs, website, public endpoints, and package download links will remain for three months to ensure a smooth transition. \n\n## Resources \n\nHere are the main information sources for the chain merge: \n\n Governance proposal Our vision behind the merge Crafting the core of Kaia DeFi Responding to institutional demand Supplementary data and insights \n\n Make this page better \n\n\n The Kaia brand story \n\nEdit this page Last updated on **Jan 24, 2025** \n\n Is this page helpful? \n\n Make this page better \n\n\n",

    " Service Chain Upgrade Service Chain \n\n# Upgrade Service Chain \n\n#### Kaia and its ServiceChain have constantly released new versions to develop new features and fix bugs. \n\n#### This page is a guide to upgrade ServiceChain binaries and setting hard fork block numbers for your \n\n#### ServiceChain. \n\n## Upgrade \n\n#### This section shows how to upgrade the ServiceChain binary. \n\n#### NOTE Upgrading ServiceChain binaries may be irreversible and backward-incompatible, meaning you \n\n#### cannot downgrade to an older version. Refer to the release notes for more details. For example, the Kaia \n\n#### v1.9.0 release note says: \n\n#### NOTE: This version updates the version of the database to support snapshot sync. You cannot \n\n#### downgrade to the older versions with existing data after updating to v1.9.0. \n\n#### You can get the latest version of Kaia and ServiceChain binaries in one of the below links: \n\n#### Kaia Docs \n\n#### Kaia Github Repository \n\n#### To upgrade the ServiceChain binary, stop the ServiceChain node and replace the binary. For example, \n\n#### you can use below commands to stop an SCN node and replace the binary with a newer one. \n\n#### You may restart the ServiceChain node after the upgrade. However, if you are planning to activate hard \n\n#### fork in the ServiceChain, you have to keep the ServiceChain nodes down. Refer to the Hard Fork for \n\n#### instructions of ServiceChain hard fork. \n\n## Hard Fork \n\n $ kscnd stop Shutting down kscnd: OK $ cp /path/to/new/kscn /path/to/original/kscn \n\n $ kscnd start \n\n\n#### This section describes the steps for applying Kaia hard forks to ServiceChain. \n\n#### To apply the hard fork to the ServiceChain, you need to: \n\n#### 1. Pick an appropriate block number for the hard fork \n\n#### 2. Upgrade the ServiceChain binary to a version that supports the hard fork \n\n#### 3. Set the hard fork block number in the ServiceChain \n\n### 1. Pick an appropriate block number for the hard fork \n\n#### In the Javascript console of the ServiceChain, you can check the current block number as shown below. \n\n#### Now, you have to choose an appropriate block number to activate the hard fork. Make sure to have \n\n#### enough number of blocks (which is produced every second) between the current block and the block of \n\n#### hard fork. \n\n### 2. Upgrade the ServiceChain binary \n\n#### Refer to the Upgrade section in this page for instructions on upgrading the ServiceChain binaries. Make \n\n#### sure to keep the ServiceChain nodes down (or stopped) for now. You will restart them after you have set \n\n#### the hard fork block number. \n\n### 3. Set the Hard Fork Block Number \n\n#### If you have upgraded the ServiceChain binaries with a version that supports the desired hard fork, you \n\n#### can set the hard fork block number in the ServiceChain by re-initializing the chain config with updated \n\n#### genesis. \n\n#### Update genesis and re-initialize chain config for all ServiceChain nodes \n\n#### First, specify the hard fork number in the config field of genesis.json.

    " Node Quick Reference Use AWS AMIs \n\n# Use AWS AMIs \n\n SERVICE NO LONGER UPDATED The AWS AMI service for Kaia endpoint nodes is no longer being updated (last update: November 2024). While existing AMIs (dated November 2024) are still available for use, please note that they may require additional synchronization time to catch up with the current blockchain state. For alternative setup methods, such as using chaindata snapshots or performing full synchronization, please refer to Block Synchronization. \n\nKaia offers an AWS AMI (Amazon Machine Image) for Kaia endpoint nodes (EN). These AMIs are preinstalled with both the EN software and the chaindata, enabling users to quickly and conveniently launch a fully operational node. With Kaia’s AMI, setting up a new endpoint node on demand becomes seamless, allowing for simplifying the process of joining the Kaia network. \n\n## Why use AMI \n\nAMI offers a convenient way to launch a new Kaia EN. Also, as its chaindata is already set, you don’t need extra disk storage to download and extract compressed chaindata. Additionally, using AMI is the only option to operate a new EN without full sync for some sync modes, such as archive mode or full mode without state migration (we only provide snapshot download for pruned chaindata). \n\n## Types of EN AMIs \n\nKaia provides different types of AMIs, whose chaindata has been synced with different modes. \n\n Type Sync Mode AMI Name \n\n full Full mode \n\n kaia-xxxx-clean-full-enxxxx \n\n pruning Full mode, live pruning enabled kaia-xxxx-clean-pruning-enxxxx \n\n statemigrated \n\n Full mode, state migrated (or state batch pruned) kaia-xxxx-clean-en-xxxx \n\n\n Type Sync Mode AMI Name \n\n archive Archive mode \n\n kaia-xxxx-clean-archive-enxxxx \n\nKaia provides these 4 types of AMIs for mainnet. There are also AMIs for Kairos except for the (^) full type. See State Batch Pruning for more details on state migrated chaindata. See Block Synchronization for more details on block sync modes. \n\n## Launch new EC2 instance with AMI in Amazon \n\n## console \n\nWhen launching a new EC2 instance in the AWS console, you should select an AMI. Search for (^) kaiamainnet in the AMI search bar. The page will bring you to the search results. Click \"Community AMIs\" tab in the search result page and select the AMI you want to use in the list. \n\n\n### Allow inbound connections \n\nWhen launching a new EC2 instance in the AWS console, you can either create a new security group for the instance or choose existing security group. Either way, you must add inbound rules to allow connections to the ports that Kaia nodes use to communicate each other. \n\nNavigate to the EC2 instance page in the AWS console, find associated security groups in the \"Security\" tab. You should add inbound rules for port 32323-32324. \n\n IP version Type Protocol Port range Source \n\n IPv4 Custom TCP TCP 32323 32324 0.0.0.0/0 \n\n IPv4 Custom UDP UDP 32323 0.0.0.0/0 \n\n## Post-Launch Instance Preparation and Setup \n\n### Warmup Amazon EBS volumes \n\nThe Amazon EBS volumes that were created from snapshots (AMI would be one case), the storage blocks must be pulled down from Amazon S3 and written to the volume before they can be accessed. This causes a significant overhead for disk operations the first time each block is accessed. Volume performance is recovered after all blocks have been downloaded and written to the volume. For more details, see Initialize Amazon EBS volumes. Make this page better \n\n\nIn order to get our volume ready, we can run a task to read all blocks. \n\n NOTE This task to warmup Amazon EBS volume would take a long time depending on the data size. Refer \n\nto (^) fio output for the ETA. **Check** (^) **kend.conf configuration** Before starting the node, check NETWORK and NETWORK_ID fields in the configuration file kend.conf. The (^) kend.conf file is located in (^) /etc/kend/conf/kend.conf. For Mainnet, the NETWORK field should be mainnet. For Kairos, the NETWORK field should be kairos. Note that NETWORK_ID is only used for private network. Thus make sure not to set NETWORK_ID for Mainnet or Kairos. For more details on (^) kend.conf , see Configuration. **Start** (^) **kend service** In the EC2 instance, Kaia CLI client and the chaindata are installed. Also, (^) kend , the script to start/terminate EN, is installed as a service. You can check the kend service’s status by the following command. If the service is not running, try to restart it. $ sudo yum install -y fio $ sudo fio --filename=/dev/nvme1n1 --rw=read --bs=128k --iodepth=32 --ioengine=libaio --d # for Mainnet NETWORK=mainnet # for Kairos NETWORK=kairos $ sudo service kend status $ sudo service kend restart \n\n\nIf the service restarted and the EN has started successfully, you can check its logs in the path /var/kend/logs/kend.out. \n\nKaia provides a CLI client ken^ console^. You can interact with the Kaia node using the ken^ console^ via multiple endpoints, and one option is to use IPC (inter-process communication). The IPC file klay.ipc \n\nis located in the (^) DATA_DIR path on an EN, in our case (^) /var/kend/data. Thus in order to use (^) ken console : \n\n### Wait for block sync \n\nSince the AMI was created hours ago, we need some time to sync to the latest block. You can check the currently synced block number and the sync progress in the ken console. \n\nWhen the block sync is done, querying sync progress should return false. \n\nEdit this page Last updated on **Jan 24, 2025** \n\n $ tail -f /var/kend/logs/kend.out \n\n $ sudo ken attach --datadir /var/kend/data Welcome to the Kaia JavaScript console! instance: Kaia/vX.X.X/XXXX-XXXX/goX.X.X datadir: /var/kend/data modules: admin:1.0 debug:1.0 governance:1.0 istanbul:1.0 klay:1.0 miner:1.0 net:1.0 per > \n\n > klay.blockNumber 165227166 > klay.syncing { currentBlock: 165227166 , highestBlock: 165357203 , knownStates: 0 , pulledStates: 0 , startingBlock: 165222272 } \n\n > klay.syncing false \n\n(^) Make this page better \n\n\nIs this page helpful? \n\n\n",

It’s as simple as uploading / copy & pasting a single CSV transfer file and hitting the submit button. \n\nThis single method saves gas ⛽ and a substantial amount of time ⌚ by requiring less signatures and transactions. \n\nLet’s get started with an example using CSV Airdrop! \n\n## Step 1: Login into your KaiaSafe \n\nIf you haven’t created a Safe account yet, please refer to our Create a Safe Guide and Add Asset Guide to set up your account and add assets (KAIA, FT, NFT). \n\n## Step 2: Click apps, search CSV and select CSV \n\n## Airdrop \n\n\n## Step 3: Prepare a Transfer CSV file \n\nTransfer files are expected to be in CSV format with the following required columns: \n\n token_type: The type of token that is being transferred. One of erc20,nft or native. NFT Tokens can be either ERC721 or ERC1155. token_address: Ethereum address of ERC20 token to be transferred. This has to be left blank for native (ETH) transfers. receiver: Ethereum address of transfer receiver. amount: the amount of token to be transferred. This can be left blank for erc721 transfers. id: The id of the collectible token (erc721 or erc1155) to transfer. This can be left blank for native and erc20 transfers. \n\n IMPORTANT The CSV file has to use \",\" as a separator and the header row always has to be provided as the first row and include the described column names. Sample Transfer File \n\n### Native Token Transfers Make^ this^ page^ better \n\n\nSince native tokens do not have a token address, you must leave the token_address column blank for native transfers. \n\n NOTE Make sure you have enough native tokens in the kaia safe wallet address. \n\n### ERC-20 Transfers \n\nProvide erc20 as token_type for erc20 transfers and other respective fields accordingly. \n\n NOTE Make sure you have enough erc20 tokens in the kaia safe wallet address. \n\n### ERC-721 Transfers \n\nProvide erc721 as token_type for erc721 transfers and other respective fields accordingly. \n\n\n NOTE Make sure you have enough erc721 tokens in the kaia safe wallet address. \n\n### Illustration \n\nFor this illustration, we have 2 native transfers, 2 ERC20 transfers and 1 ERC721 transfers \n\n## Step 4: Review and submit transaction \n\n\nYou'll be able to review and confirm the transaction.

    " Service Chain Configure Service Chain Use Data Anchoring with KAS \n\n# Use Data Anchoring with KAS \n\n#### As explained in the design section, you can anchor your service chain data to Kaia main chain. This page \n\n#### introduces how to enable data anchoring via KAS (Kaia API Service). \n\n#### Once it is turned on, a node in your service chain can periodically anchor its chain data (block data) to \n\n#### Mainnet or Kairos as a proof of existence and immutability of the service chain. This ensures the security \n\n#### and credibility of the service chain. \n\n## Preparation for Using KAS \n\n#### This section introduces the pre-requisites to use KAS for data anchoring. \n\n## Sign Up KAS (Kaia API Service) \n\n#### First, you need to sign up KAS on the KAS console website to get a KAS account. Please visit the website \n\n#### above and sign up in KAS. \n\n\n### Create Credential Make this page better \n\n\nAfter login, you can create your credential like below. The (^) AccessKey ID and (^) Secret AccessKey , or \n\n#### Authorization will be used to call KAS APIs. \n\n## Anchor API \n\n#### KAS provides Anchor API, which is designed for data anchoring and surely it is the one that you are going \n\n#### to use for anchoring task. \n\n## Create Operator Address Make^ this^ page^ better \n\n\n#### To anchor service chain data via KAS, there should be a Kaia address, enrolled in KAS, that actually send \n\n#### anchoring transaction to Kaia. So, before you set up your service node, you need to create an Kaia \n\n#### account called \"operator\" via KAS. Please, use KAS console to create this account. \n\n#### It is important to be noticed that you must first select the chain in Kaia to which you want to anchor \n\n#### your data on the top right corner of the KAS console page. You should create an operator for each \n\n#### chain (Mainnet/Kairos). \n\n#### Create an operator as below. \n\n#### Then, you can check your operator list like below. Please note that the address of an operator is required \n\n#### for setting your service chain node. \n\n\n## Configure Service Chain Node \n\n#### After obtaining API credentials, Anchor API information (API endpoint and parameters), and an operator \n\n#### account in KAS, then It is time to set up your service chain node.

    " Tools Wallets Kaia Safe Use Kaia Safe \n\n# Use Kaia Safe \n\n## Create a Safe \n\nHere you will see how to create a Safe and evaluate its benefits on the Kaia Network. \n\n**Step 1:** Navigate to Kaia Safe App. By navigating to the application on your web browser, you can explore the functionality of Kaia Safe. \n\n**Step 2:** Connect your wallet. At the moment, Kaia Safe support various wallets like Kaia Wallet, MetaMask wallet, etc. \n\nFor the sake of this guide, we will be using MetaMask. Make sure you have Kaia networks(Mainnet or Kairos Testnet) added to your MetaMask wallet to connect successfully. \n\n**Step 3:** Once your wallet is connected, click **Create Account** and give your new Safe a **name**. This name is linked to your safe account, which is a multi-signature wallet that holds and stores all of your funds. \n\n**Step 4:** Add owners/signers by inputting the addresses that have permission to submit and approve transactions. You can add as many signers as you want and remove or replace any of them at any time. \n\n\n**Step 5:** Choose how many signer confirmations a transaction in your Safe account needs to be approved. It is important to note that by default our app allows one signer confirmation. But it is advisable to use a threshold higher than 1 to ensure a secured safe account. Good practice is to use a threshold of 51% of the total owners e.g, 2 out of 3, 3 out of 5 etc as shown below: \n\n**Step 6:** Review and deploy Safe \n\nOnce you are completely satisfied with all of your Safe parameters, you can submit the creation of your Safe account and proceed with the on-screen instructions to complete the account creation. \n\nCongratulations on successfully creating your Kaia Safe account! \n\n\n## Add assets \n\nIn this section, you will see how to add assets (KAIA, FT, NFT) to your safe account and keep your funds safe. \n\n### KAIA Deposits \n\nBelow are the steps to add **KAIA** to your safe account \n\n**Step 1:** Copy your Safe address from your account dashboard. \n\n**Step 2:** Open your Metamask wallet and click **send** to send asset to your safe account. \n\nNote that there are different ways to send assets to your Safe account. You can send from your hardware wallet, web wallet, or even a smart contract. In this case, we’re making use of a web wallet called MetaMask. \n\n\n**Step 3:** Paste your safe address in the search field as seen below. \n\n**Step 4:** Input **amount** and click **next**. \n\n\n**Step 5:** Confirm the transaction and check your asset dashboard. You can see the amount being transferred from your metamask account to your Kaia Safe account. \n\n### KIP-7 Deposits \n\nNow we will see how to deposit KIP7 (fungible tokens) to our safe by following the below steps. \n\n**Step 1:** Copy your Safe address from your account dashboard. \n\n\n**Step 2:** Open your Metamask Wallet and navigate to **assets** tab. \n\n**Step 3:** Select the token you will love to send and click **send**. \n\n\n**Step 4:** Repeat step **3** , **4** , **5** of **KAIA** Deposits above. \n\n**Step 5:** View your assets dashboard, you can see the KIP7 tokens being transferred to your safe account. Similarly you can transfer any Fungible token to your safe account. \n\n\n### KIP-17 (NFTs) Deposits \n\nNow we will see how to deposit KIP17 (Non Fungible tokens) to our safe by following the steps below. \n\nYou can transfer your NFT’s to your safe account in many different ways. Here is an example on how to transfer NFT to the safe account using OpenSea. \n\n1. Navigate to your OpenSea account profile page \n\n2. Navigate to an NFT you ll love to transfer. Make sure to select a NFT on the Kaia Network(Mainnet or     Kairos) \n\n3. On the next page, click on the transfer button. \n\n4. Paste the safe address in the text box and transfer to safe \n\n5. Under Assets section in Kaia Safe you can find NFT’s from OpenSea. \n\nPlease refer to this guide from OpenSea for more details on transferring NFTs. \n\n## Send assets \n\nIn this section, you’ll learn how to send KAIA and KIP-7 tokens from your Kaia Safe account. \n\n### Send KAIA & KIP7 Tokens \n\n**Step 1:** Click the **New Transaction** button in the side menu and select **Send tokens** to begin a new asset transfer. \n\n\n**Step 2:** Choose assets to transfer. \n\n KAIA \n\n Note: Add the recipient address and the amount of KAIA to send the transfer KAIA. \n\n KIP-7 Tokens \n\nSelect the tokens you want to send in the asset drop-down as seen in the image above. \n\n Note: Add the recipient address and the number of tokens to transfer KIP7 tokens. \n\n\n**Step 3:** Review and submit the transaction. You will need to sign the transaction with your signer wallet, and it will be executed once the confirmation threshold is reached. \n\n### Send NFTs \n\nIn this section, you’ll learn how to send your non-fungible tokens from your Kaia Safe account. \n\n**Step 1:** Click the **New Transaction** button in the side menu and select **Send NFTs** to begin a new asset transfer. \n\n**Step 2:** Choose assets to transfer. \n\n\n**Step 3:** Review and submit the transaction. You will need to sign the transaction with your signer wallet, and it will be executed once the confirmation threshold is reached. \n\n## Further Notes \n\nThe following are things you will want to keep in mind while using Kaia Safe: \n\n### Transaction Fees \n\nKaia Safe transactions, whether asset transfers or contract interactions, incur a fee that will be paid by the signer that executes the transaction (usually the last signer to reach the required threshold of^ Make^ this^ page^ better \n\n\nsignatures). \n\n### Safe Nonce \n\nFor security reasons, transactions made with Safe need to be executed in order. To achieve this, a number called **nonce** is assigned to a transaction to ensure that each transaction can be executed once. \n\nAt any given time, only transactions with a nonce last executed transaction +1 can be executed. Transactions with a higher nonce are queued for execution. So, whenever a transaction is completed, the next transaction in the queue is made available for execution, provided it has accumulated enough signatures. \n\n\n### Chain-specific addresses \n\nYou can choose to copy address with chain prefix \n\n Copy addresses with chain prefix: \n\n\nWhen copying your safe address from your dashboard to paste in your wallet as seen above, you can either choose to add the chain name or not by clicking the checkbox. It is suggested that you leave it unchecked to avoid the error below. \n\n\nEdit this page Last updated on **Jan 24, 2025** \n\n Is this page helpful? \n\n\n",
    " Tools Wallets Kaia Safe Use Transaction Builder \n\n# Use Transaction Builder \n\nThis is a custom app in Kaia Safe that is responsible for batching transactions. This means that we you can bundle several transactions together, instead of having to confirm one transaction after the other. You just have to confirm and execute once. \n\nWith transaction builder, you can compose transactions from token transfers to complex contract interactions and batch them into a single transaction. \n\n## KAIA Token Transfer \n\nYou can perform token transfer using transaction builder by following the steps below: \n\n**Step 1:** Navigate to Safe Apps and open Transaction Builder Safe App \n\n**Step 2:** Enter the recipient wallet address. For this guide, kindly skip the ABI field as we are trying to execute KAIA transfer transaction. \n\n\n**Step 3:** Enter the KAIA value you want to send. \n\n Note: In this guide, we are sending 1 KAIA, so we entered 1 in the KAIA value input field. You can input any amount here, depending on your Safe’s KAIA balance. \n\n**Step 4:** Click Add transaction. \n\n**Step 5:** Repeat steps 2, 3, and 4 for every recipient address. \n\n\n**Step 6:** Once you added all operations to the batch click Create Batch. \n\n**Step 7:** Review and submit transaction \n\nYou'll be able to review the whole batch. Once ready, click Send Batch to submit and execute the transaction just like any other Safe transaction. \n\n## Contract Interactions \n\nLet’s say you want to airdrop tokens to a long list of addresses, say 10 CCT tokens to 5 addresses. Instead of having to create 5 transactions, which the owners of your safe have to confirm and execute one after the other, the transaction builder puts all these transfers into a single transaction. \n\nIn this guide, we have minted CCT tokens to the Safe address for illustrative purpose. \n\nLet’s get started with this example using Transaction Builder! \n\n**Step 1:** Open Safe Apps. \n\n\n**Step 2:** Open the Transaction Builder Safe app \n\n**Step 3:** Enter your **token contract address** and **ABI**. \n\n\nIn this example, CCT contract address and ABI will be used. You can copy and paste your ABI into the **Enter ABI** field. \n\n**Step 4:** Select a method and fill the transaction information \n\nFrom the drop-down you can select a method. In this case, we select the **transfer** method. For this step to be completed, you have to fill out the transaction information, such as **to(address)** and **amount(uint256)**. \n\nNote: The value is an unsigned integer without any decimals. In this example, the CCT token has 18 decimals. So if you want to send 10 CCT, you have to enter 10000000000000000000. \n\n**Step 5:** Click **Add transaction** \n\n Make this page better \n\n\n**Step 6:** Repeat steps **4** , **5** , and **6** for every recipient address. \n\n**Step 7:** Once you added all operations to the batch click **Create Batch** \n\n**Step 8:** Review and submit transaction \n\nYou'll be able to review the whole batch. Once ready, click **Send Batch** to submit and execute the transaction just like any other Safe transaction. \n\nEdit this page Last updated on **Jan 24, 2025** \n\n Is this page helpful? \n\n\n",

    " Why Build on Kaia \n\n# Why Build on Kaia \n\nKaia Blockchain aims to become Asia’s #1 blockchain, leading the adoption of Web3 by providing a robust infrastructure for projects of all sizes. This document explains how Kaia is different based on its key design principles and value propositions. \n\n## Wide User Base \n\n1. **Web2 User Accessibility** : Kaia provides easy access to existing Web2 users through messenger-     integrated wallets, collaborating with Kakao (50 million Korean users) and LINE (200 million users in     Japan, Taiwan, Indonesia, and Thailand). \n\n2. **Web3 User Accessibility** : Kaia offers more than 1.2 million active wallet addresses and interfaces     connecting users to projects, facilitating quick attraction of Web3 users. \n\n3. **Community Building Support** : Joint marketing with Kaia Foundation helps users gather and build     projects, providing an environment with easy access for users from various chains. \n\n## Abundant Liquidity Support \n\n1. **Real World Asset (RWA) Linkage** : Kaia Blockchain hosts various real-world assets like gold, ships,     and real estate. Future plans include on-chaining fiat-backed stablecoins and bonds, expanding the     range of assets available to developers. \n\n2. **Large-Scale Ecosystem Fund** : The Kaia Ecosystem Fund, based on KAIA tokens, supports various     sectors requiring liquidity, such as DeFi and GameFi. \n\n3. **Chain Native Yield** : Built-in MEV (Maximal Extractable Value) extraction allows KAIA Stakers to     automatically earn MEV profits, increasing chain liquidity and providing a token burning mechanism. \n\n## Top-Level Core Technology and Development \n\n## Convenience \n\n1. **High Performance** : \n\n Main chain handles at least 4,000 TPS with immediate transaction finality and one-second block generation time. Make^ this^ page^ better \n\n\n Scalability through customizable and easily deployable Service Chains as L2 solutions. \n\n2. **Ethereum Compatibility** : \n\n 100% compatibility ensures EVM-based dApps can be onboarded without modifications. Development tools, EVM, and APIs are equivalent to Ethereum, allowing seamless integration and mutual benefit to both ecosystems. See Solidity-Smart Contract Language, and Migrating Ethereum App to Kaia. \n\n3. **Convenient Account Model** : Enables assigning various keys to accounts, strengthening security     and improving user experience. \n\n4. **Permissionless and Decentralized Structure** : Kaia is transitioning to a permissionless validator     structure, increasing network decentralization. \n\n## Low Cost and Enhanced User Experience \n\n1. **Affordable Transaction Fees** : End-users are not burdened with high transaction fees. Costs are     stable and determined by transaction complexity. See Affordable Smart Contract Execution Cost     and Transaction Fees. \n\n2. **Fee Delegation** : Applications can cover users' transaction fees, allowing for flexible business     models and lowering user acquisition barriers. \n\n## Open-Source Infrastructure and Ecosystem \n\n## Support \n\n1. **Primary Infrastructure** : Includes SDKs, smart contract libraries, wallets, chain explorers,     distributed storage solutions, Oracle support, and bridges. \n\n2. **Secondary Infrastructure** : Ecosystem for supporting products and services, including integration     services, stablecoin integrations, DAOs, NFT marketplaces, DEX, DeFi, and traditional finance     interfaces. \n\n3. **Ecosystem Fund** : 50% of newly minted tokens are reinvested in the ecosystem through Kaia     Ecosystem Fund and Kaia Infrastructure Fund. \n\n## Community Co-Building and Governance \n\n1. **Diverse Community Engagement** : Kaia expands its ecosystem through collaboration with game     guilds, investment DAOs, community DAOs, and global alliances. Make^ this^ page^ better \n\n\n2. **Decentralized Governance** : The Kaia Governance Council (GC) includes traditional enterprises,     DAOs, and builders, creating a unique governance structure with hundreds of participants. \n\nIn summary, Kaia maintains blockchain’s core characteristics of transparency, security, and decentralization while providing these enhancements. The protocol remains stable with strongly committed stakeholders, creating an ideal environment for builders to bring innovative Web3 ideas to life. \n\nEdit this page Last updated on **Jan 24, 2025** \n\n Is this page helpful? \n\n Make this page better \n\n\n",
    " Tools Oracles Witnet \n\n# Witnet \n\n## Introduction \n\nThe Witnet multichain decentralized oracle enables smart contracts to actualize their potential by providing them access to all sorts of valuable external data sets. These valuable data sets include sports results, stock prices, weather forecasts, randomness, et al. To offer decentralized oracle services, Witnet relies on a distributed network of peer nodes— colloquially called witnesses—who earn Wit tokens as a reward for retrieving web data and reporting it directly to the smart contracts. The witnesses are responsible for sourcing, retrieving, and verifying the data sets. To ensure transparency, each anonymous peer is incentivized to report the retrieved data honestly and is punished or slashed for any wrongdoing. \n\n## Usage \n\nThis oracle network is currently running on the Kaia Mainnet and Kaia Kairos Testnet. To get started with connecting to the data feeds and randomness on Kaia, refer to the following guides: \n\n Witnet Price-Feed Tutorial Random Number Generation on Kaia with Witnet \n\nEdit this page Last updated on **Jan 24, 2025** \n\nIs this page helpful?

It currently has support for 30+ chains including Kaia. By integrating wormhole, a Kaia application can make any token natively multichain, pull any on-chain data on-demand and build custom multi chain protocols. \n\n## Usage \n\nWormhole supports both Kaia Mainnet and Kairos Testnet.

    " RPC API Reference debug runtimeDebug debug_memStats \n\n# [runtimeDebug] debug_memStats \n\n## Returns detailed runtime memory statistics. \n\n## JSONRPC: debug_memStats \n\n## Request \n\n APPLICATION/JSON \n\n BODY \n\n## Responses 200 \n\n## Returns detailed runtime memory statistics. \n\n APPLICATION/JSON \n\n Schema Example (from schema) \n\n**SCHEMA** \n\n params array \n\n error object result Returns detailed runtime memory statistics. \n\n object \n\n Alloc REQUIRED Alloc is bytes of allocated heap objects. This is the same as HeapAlloc \n\n string \n\n TotalAlloc REQUIRED TotalAlloc is cumulative bytes allocated for heap objects. TotalAlloc increases as heap objects are allocated, but unlike Alloc and HeapAlloc, it does not decrease when objects are freed. \n\n string \n\n Sys REQUIRED Sys is the total bytes of memory obtained from the OS. Sys is the sum of the XSys fields below. Sys measures the virtual address space reserved by the Go runtime for the heap, stacks, and other internal data structures. It’s likely that not all of the virtual address space is backed by physical memory at any given moment, though in general it all was at some point. \n\n string \n\n Lookups REQUIRED Lookups is the number of pointer lookups performed by the runtime. This is primarily useful for debugging runtime internals \n\n string \n\n Mallocs REQUIRED Mallocs is the cumulative count of heap objects allocated. The number of live objects is Mallocs Frees. \n\n string \n\n Frees string REQUIRED \n\n Make this page better \n\n\nFrees is the cumulative count of heap objects freed. \n\n**HeapAlloc REQUIRED** HeapAlloc is bytes of allocated heap objects. \"Allocated\" heap objects include all reachable objects, as well as unreachable objects that the garbage collector has not yet freed. Specifically, HeapAlloc increases as heap objects are allocated and decreases as the heap is swept and unreachable objects are freed. Sweeping occurs incrementally between GC cycles, so these two processes occur simultaneously, and as a result HeapAlloc tends to change smoothly (in contrast with the sawtooth that is typical of stop-the-world garbage collectors). \n\n string \n\n**HeapSys REQUIRED** HeapSys is bytes of heap memory obtained from the OS. HeapSys measures the amount of virtual address space reserved for the heap. This includes virtual address space that has been reserved but not yet used, which consumes no physical memory, but tends to be small, as well as virtual address space for which the physical memory has been returned to the OS after it became unused (see HeapReleased for a measure of the latter). HeapSys estimates the largest size the heap has had. \n\n string \n\n**HeapIdle REQUIRED** HeapIdle is bytes in idle (unused) spans. Idle spans have no objects in them. These spans could be (and may already have been) returned to the OS, or they can be reused for heap allocations, or they can be reused as stack memory. HeapIdle minus HeapReleased estimates the amount of memory that could be returned to the OS, but is being retained by the runtime so it can grow the heap without requesting more memory from the OS. If this difference is significantly larger than the heap size, it indicates there was a recent transient spike in live heap size. \n\n string \n\n**HeapInuse REQUIRED** HeapInuse is bytes in in-use spans. In-use spans have at least one object in them. These spans can only be used for other objects of roughly the same size. HeapInuse minus HeapAlloc estimates the amount of memory that has been dedicated to particular size classes, but is not currently being used. This is an upper bound on fragmentation, but in general this memory can be reused efficiently. \n\n string \n\n**HeapReleased REQUIRED** HeapReleased is bytes of physical memory returned to the OS. This counts heap memory from idle spans that was returned to the OS and has not yet been reacquired for the heap. \n\n string \n\n**HeapObjects REQUIRED** HeapObjects is the number of allocated heap objects. Like HeapAlloc, this increases as objects are allocated and decreases as the heap is swept and unreachable objects are freed \n\n string \n\n**StackInuse REQUIRED** StackInuse is bytes in stack spans. In-use stack spans have at least one stack in them. These spans can only be used for other stacks of the same size. There is no StackIdle because unused stack spans are returned to the heap (and hence counted toward HeapIdle). \n\n string \n\n**StackSys REQUIRED** StackSys is bytes of stack memory obtained from the OS. StackSys is StackInuse, plus any memory obtained directly from the OS for OS thread stacks (which should be minimal). \n\n string \n\n**MSpanSys REQUIRED** MSpanSys is bytes of memory obtained from the OS for mspan structures. \n\n string \n\n**MSpanInuse REQUIRED** MCacheInuse is bytes of allocated mcache structures. \n\n string \n\n**MCacheSys REQUIRED** MCacheSys is bytes of memory obtained from the OS for mcache structures. \n\n string Make^ this^ page^ better \n\n\n**BuckHashSys REQUIRED** BuckHashSys is bytes of memory in profiling bucket hash tables. \n\n string \n\n**GCSys REQUIRED** \n\nGCSys is bytes of memory in garbage collection metadata. \n\n string \n\n**OtherSys REQUIRED** OtherSys is bytes of memory in miscellaneous off-heap runtime allocations. \n\n string \n\n**NextGC REQUIRED** NextGC is the target heap size of the next GC cycle. The garbage collector’s goal is to keep HeapAlloc ≤ NextGC. At the end of each GC cycle, the target for the next cycle is computed based on the amount of reachable data and the value of GOGC. \n\n string \n\n**LastGC REQUIRED** LastGC is the time the last garbage collection finished, as nanoseconds since 1970 (the UNIX epoch). \n\n string \n\n**PauseTotalNs REQUIRED** PauseTotalNs is the cumulative nanoseconds in GC stop-the-world pauses since the program started. During a stop-the-world pause, all goroutines are paused and only the garbage collector can run. \n\n string \n\n**PauseNs REQUIRED** PauseNs is a circular buffer of recent GC stop-the-world pause times in nanoseconds. The most recent pause is at PauseNs[(NumGC+255)%256]. In general, PauseNs[N%256] records the time paused in the most recent N%256th GC cycle. There may be multiple pauses per GC cycle; this is the sum of all pauses during a cycle. \n\n string[] \n\n**PauseEnd REQUIRED** PauseEnd is a circular buffer of recent GC pause end times, as nanoseconds since 1970 (the UNIX epoch). This buffer is filled the same way as PauseNs. There may be multiple pauses per GC cycle; this records the end of the last pause in a cycle. \n\n string[] \n\n**NumGC REQUIRED** NumGC is the number of completed GC cycles. \n\n string \n\n**NumForcedGC REQUIRED** NumForcedGC is the number of GC cycles that were forced by the application calling the GC function. \n\n string \n\n**GCCPUFraction REQUIRED** GCCPUFraction is the fraction of this program’s available CPU time used by the GC since the program started. GCCPUFraction is expressed as a number between 0 and 1, where 0 means GC has consumed none of this program’s CPU. A program’s available CPU time is defined as the integral of GOMAXPROCS since the program started. That is, if GOMAXPROCS is 2 and a program has been running for 10 seconds, its \"available CPU\" is 20 seconds. GCCPUFraction does not include CPU time used for write barrier activity. This is the same as the fraction of CPU reported by GODEBUG=gctrace=1. \n\n string \n\n**EnableGC REQUIRED** EnableGC indicates that GC is enabled. It is always true, even if GOGC=off. \n\n boolean \n\n**DebugGC REQUIRED** \n\nDebugGC is currently unused. \n\n boolean \n\n**BySize REQUIRED** \n\n BySize reports per-size class allocation statistics. BySize[N] gives statistics for allocations of size S where BySize[N-1].Size < S ≤ BySize[N].Size. This does not report allocations larger than BySize[60].Size. \n\n object[] \n\n Array [ Make this page better \n\n\n CURL PYTHON NODEJS JAVA \n\n CURL \n\n CURL \n\n Size Size is the maximum byte size of an object in this size class. \n\n string \n\n Mallocs Mallocs is the cumulative count of heap objects allocated in this size class.

It is available on npm. \n\n## Features \n\n#### Complete implementation of kaia’s JSON-RPC client API over HTTP and Websocket \n\n#### Support of kaia transaction, account, and account key types \n\n#### JavaScript smart contract package to deploy and execute a smart contract on the kaia network \n\n#### In-memory wallet for managing kaia accounts \n\n#### Support of fee-delegation \n\n#### Support of the kaia wallet key format \n\n#### Encoding/decoding of a transaction object in RLP \n\n#### Signing of a transaction object \n\n#### Easy to port web3-js application to caver-js \n\n## Packages in caver-js \n\n#### Below are packages provided in caver-js. \n\n#### caver.account \n\n#### caver.wallet.keyring \n\n#### caver.wallet \n\ncaver.transaction (^) Make this page better \n\n\n#### caver.rpc \n\n#### caver.contract \n\n#### caver.abi \n\n#### caver.kct \n\n#### caver.validator \n\n#### caver.utils \n\n#### caver.ipfs \n\n## Error Code Improvement \n\n#### The error messages from Ethereum via web3.js are hardly figuring out where the error occurs. caver\n\n#### js improves the interface to catch error messages from kaia. \n\n#### More details can be found in the value of txError of the transaction receipt like the below: \n\n## Caution when Sending a Transaction to kaia \n\n#### Kaia has a new gas price policy since the Magma hard fork which enabled the KIP-71. \n\n#### Therefore, you need to set the gasPrice logic differently when sending a transaction, depending on \n\n#### whether the hard fork is applicable or not. \n\n#### Until the Magma hard fork, transactions on kaia have been subject to a \"fixed gas price\". Therefore, \n\n#### transactions with any other price submitted to the network are rejected. If gasPrice is not defined \n\n#### when you sign or submit a transaction, caver-js uses caver.rpc.klay.getGasPrice RPC call to set the gas \n\n#### price. \n\n Error: runtime error occurred in interpreter { \"blockHash\": \"0xe7ec35c9fff1178d52cee1d46d40627d19f828c4b06ad1a5c3807698b99acb20\", \"blockNumber\": 7811, \"contractAddress\": null, \"from\": \"0xa8a2d37727197cc0eb827f8c5a3a3aceb26cf59e\", \"gasUsed\": 9900000000, \"logsBloom\": \"0x00000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000 \"status\": false, \"to\": \"0xf8425b0f65147969621f9390ca06139c7b439497\", \"transactionHash\": \"0x85ce2b307899c90144442d9b3236827ac57375c522be2435093aebfd920b8c58\" \"transactionIndex\": 0, \"txError\": \"0x2\", \"events\": {} } \n\n Make this page better \n\n\n#### After the Magma hard fork, kaia uses a \"dynamic gas fee pricing mechanism\". The gas price of the \n\n#### transaction should be higher than the base fee of the kaia network. If gasPrice is not defined when you \n\n#### sign or submit a transaction, caver-js sets the gasPrice field of the transaction using \n\n#### caver.rpc.klay.getGasPrice. \n\n### How to set gasPrice field \n\ncaver-js provides various ways to set the (^) gasPrice. Ways to set the (^) gasPrice field when using caver\n\n#### js are suggested below. The methods described here can be used regardless of the hard fork. \n\n#### Do not define gasPrice^ field \n\n#### If you create an instance without defining the gasPrice field, the gasPrice field is automatically set \n\n#### when you call tx.sign or tx.signAsFeePayer to sign a transaction. \n\n#### Use tx.fillTransaction method \n\n#### You can use tx.fillTransaction^ , a function that fills the optional fields of a transaction with \n\n#### appropriate values when they are omitted. \n\n**Use** (^) **tx.suggestGasPrice method** \n\n#### You can set the gasPrice with the result of tx.suggestGasPrice which returns the recommended \n\n#### gas price. \n\n#### For more information about the gas price, see Gas and Unit Price Overview The price of gas used in the \n\n#### network can be obtained by using caver.rpc.klay.getGasPrice. \n\n## Links \n\n#### caver-js GitHub repository \n\n#### caver-js on npm \n\n const tx = caver.transaction.valueTransfer.create({ from, to, value, gas }) await tx.sign(from, tx) // Before signing, gasPrice is set inside tx.sign. \n\n const tx = caver.transaction.valueTransfer.create({ from, to, value, gas }) await tx.fillTransaction() // Fill the optional tx fields. \n\n const tx = caver.transaction.valueTransfer.create({ from, to, value, gas }) tx.gasPrice = await tx.suggestGasPrice() \n\n Make this page better \n\n\n#### Edit this page \n\nLast updated on **Jan 24, 2025** \n\n#### Is this page helpful? \n\n Make this page better \n\n\n",

    " SDKs and Libraries caver-js API References caver.contract \n\n# caver.contract \n\nThe (^) caver.contract object makes it easy to interact with smart contracts on the kaia blockchain \n\n### platform. When you create a new contract object, you have to provide the JSON interface for that smart \n\n### contract and caver-js will automatically convert all calls with the contract object in javascript into low\n\n### level ABI calls over RPC for you. \n\n### This allows you to interact with smart contracts as if they were JavaScript objects. \n\n## caver.contract.create \n\n### Creates a new contract instance with all its methods and events defined in its JSON interface object. \n\n### This function works the same as new caver.contract. \n\n### NOTE caver.contract.create is supported since caver-js v1.6.1. \n\n### Parameters \n\n### See the new caver.contract. \n\n### Return Value \n\n### See the new caver.contract. \n\n### Example \n\n caver.contract.create(jsonInterface [, address] [, options]) \n\n const contract = caver.contract.create([ { constant: true, inputs: [{ name: 'interfaceId', type: 'bytes4' }], name: 'supportsInterface', outputs: [{ name: '', type: 'bool' }], payable: false, stateMutability: 'view', type: 'function', }, ... ], '0x{address in hex}') \n\n Make this page better \n\n\n## caver.contract \n\n### Creates a new contract instance with all its methods and events defined in its JSON interface object. \n\n### Parameters \n\n### Name Type Description \n\n### jsonInterface object The JSON interface for the contract to instantiate \n\n### address string \n\n### (optional) The address of the smart contract to call.

    " SDKs and Libraries caver-js API References caver.kct caver.kct.kip17 \n\n# caver.kct.kip17 \n\n### caver.kct.kip17 helps you easily handle a smart contract that implements^ KIP-17^ as a JavaScript \n\n### object on the kaia blockchain. \n\n### The caver.kct.kip17^ inherits caver.contract to implement the KIP-17 token contract. The \n\n### caver.kct.kip17 holds the same properties of caver.contract whereas there are additional \n\n### methods to implement extra features. This section only introduces the newly added bound methods of \n\n### the caver.kct.kip17. \n\n### The code that implements KIP-17 for caver-js is available on the Kaia Contracts Github Repo. KIP-17 for \n\n### caver-js supports Ownable interface. Using this, you can designate a contract owner when deploying a \n\n### contract \n\n### For more information about KIP-17, see Kaia Improvement Proposals. \n\n## caver.kct.kip17.deploy \n\n### Deploys the KIP-17 token contract to the kaia blockchain. A contract deployed using \n\n### caver.kct.kip17.deploy is a non-fungible token that follows the KIP-17 standard. \n\n### After successful deployment, the promise will be resolved with a new KIP17 instance. \n\n### Parameters \n\n### Name Type Description \n\n### tokenInfo object \n\n### The information needed to deploy KIP-17 token contract on the kaia \n\n### blockchain. See the below table for the details. \n\n### deployer string | \n\n### object \n\n### The address in the keyring instance to deploy the KIP-17 token contract. This \n\n### address must have enough KAIA to deploy. See Keyring for more details. If \n\n### you want to define your fields to use when sending transactions, you can \n\n### pass the object type as a parameter. If you want to use Fee Delegation when \n\n### deploying KIP-17 contracts, you can define the fields related to fee \n\n caver.kct.kip17.deploy(tokenInfo, deployer) \n\n Make this page better \n\n\n### Name Type Description \n\n### delegation in the object. For the use of these fields, refer to the parameter \n\n### description of approve. \n\n### The tokenInfo object must contain the following: \n\n### Name Type Description \n\n### name string The name of the token. \n\n### symbol string The symbol of the token. \n\n### Return Value \n\n### PromiEvent : A promise combined event emitter, which is resolved with a new KIP17 instance. \n\n### Additionally, the following events can occur: \n\n### Name Type Description \n\n### transactionHash string \n\n### Fired right after the transaction is sent and a transaction hash is \n\n### available. \n\n### receipt object \n\n### Fired when the transaction receipt is available. If you want to know \n\n### about the properties inside the receipt object, see \n\n### getTransactionReceipt. Receipts from KIP17 instances have an 'events' \n\n### attribute parsed via abi instead of a 'logs' attribute. \n\n### error Error Fired if an error occurs during sending. \n\n### Token Enrollment \n\n### 1. To enroll a token on a block explorer, the contract creator must fill out a submission request form. \n\n### Make note of the specified information required on the form. \n\n### 2.

    " SDKs and Libraries caver-js API References caver.kct caver.kct.kip37 \n\n# caver.kct.kip37 \n\nThe (^) caver.kct.kip37 helps you easily handle a smart contract that implements KIP-37 as a JavaScript \n\n### object on the kaia blockchain platform (kaia). \n\n### The caver.kct.kip37^ inherits caver.contract to implement the KIP-37 token contract. The \n\n### caver.kct.kip37 holds the same properties of caver.contract whereas additional methods are \n\n### implemented for extra features. This section only introduces the newly added methods of the \n\n### caver.kct.kip37. \n\n### The code that implements KIP-37 for caver-js is available on the Kaia Contracts Github Repo. KIP-37 for \n\n### caver-js supports Ownable interface. Using this, you can designate a contract owner when deploying a \n\n### contract \n\n### For more information about KIP-37, see Kaia Improvement Proposals. \n\n**NOTE** (^) caver.kct.kip37 is supported since caver-js v1.5.7. \n\n## caver.kct.kip37.deploy \n\n### Deploys the KIP-37 token contract to the kaia blockchain. A contract deployed using \n\n### caver.kct.kip37.deploy is a multi token that follows the KIP-37 standard. \n\n### After successful deployment, the promise will be resolved with a new KIP37 instance. \n\n### Parameters \n\n### Name Type Description \n\n### tokenInfo object \n\n### The information needed to deploy a KIP-37 token contract on the kaia \n\n### blockchain. See the below table for the details. \n\n### deployer string | \n\n### object \n\n### The address in the keyring instance to deploy the KIP-37 token contract. This \n\n### address must have enough KAIA to deploy. See Keyring for more details. If \n\n### you want to define your own fields to use when sending transactions, you \n\n### can pass the object type as a parameter. Also, if you want to use Fee \n\n caver.kct.kip37.deploy(tokenInfo, deployer) \n\n Make this page better \n\n\n### Name Type Description \n\n### Delegation when deploying KIP-37 contracts, you can define fields related to \n\n### fee delegation in the object. For fields that can be defined in the object, refer \n\n### to the parameter description of create. \n\n### The tokenInfo object must contain the following: \n\n### Name Type Description \n\n### uri string \n\n### The URI for all token types, by relying on the token type ID substitution \n\n### mechanism. \n\n### Return Value \n\n### PromiEvent : A promise combined event emitter, which is resolved with a new KIP37 instance. \n\n### Additionally, the following events can occur: \n\n### Name Type Description \n\n### transactionHash string \n\n### Fired right after the transaction is sent and a transaction hash is \n\n### available. \n\n### receipt object \n\n### Fired when the transaction receipt is available. If you want to know \n\n### about the properties inside the receipt object, see \n\n### getTransactionReceipt. Receipts from KIP37 instances have an \n\n### 'events' attribute parsed via abi instead of a 'logs' attribute. \n\n### error Error Fired if an error occurs during sending. \n\n### Token Enrollment \n\n### 1. To enroll a token on a block explorer, the contract creator must fill out a submission request form. \n\n### Make note of the specified information required on the form. \n\n### 2.

    " SDKs and Libraries caver-js API References caver.kct caver.kct.kip7 \n\n# caver.kct.kip7 \n\nThe (^) caver.kct.kip7 helps you easily handle a smart contract that implements KIP-7 as a JavaScript \n\n### object on the kaia blockchain platform (kaia). \n\n### The caver.kct.kip7^ inherits caver.contract to implement the KIP-7 token contract. The \n\n### caver.kct.kip7 holds the same properties of caver.contract whereas additional methods to \n\n### implement extra features. This section only introduces the newly added bound methods of the \n\n### caver.kct.kip7. \n\n### The abi and bytecode used in the caver.kct.kip7 were implemented using the example of openzeppelin. \n\n### The code that implements KIP-7 for caver-js is available on the Kaia Contracts Github Repo. \n\n### For more information about KIP-7, see Kaia Improvement Proposals. \n\n## caver.kct.kip7.deploy \n\n### Deploys the KIP-7 token contract to the kaia blockchain. A contract deployed using caver.kct.kip7.deploy \n\n### is a fungible token that follows the KIP-7 standard. \n\n### After successful deployment, the promise will be resolved with a new KIP7 instance. \n\n### Parameters \n\n### Name Type Description \n\n### tokenInfo object \n\n### The information needed to deploy KIP-7 token contract on the kaia \n\n### blockchain. See the below table for the details. \n\n### deployer string | \n\n### object \n\n### The address of the keyring to deploy the KIP-7 token contract. This keyring \n\n### must have enough KAIA to deploy. If you want to define your own fields to \n\n### use when sending transactions, you can pass the object type as a \n\n### parameter. Also, if you want to use Fee Delegation when deploying KIP-7 \n\n### contracts, you can define fields related to fee delegation in the object. For \n\n caver.kct.kip7.deploy(tokenInfo, deployer) \n\n Make this page better \n\n\n### Name Type Description \n\n### fields that can be defined in the object, refer to the parameter description of \n\n### approve. \n\n### The tokenInfo object must contain the following: \n\n### Name Type Description \n\n### name string The name of the token. \n\n### symbol string The symbol of the token. \n\n### decimals number The number of decimal places the token uses. \n\n### initialSupply BigNumber | string | number The total amount of token to be supplied initially. \n\n### NOTE The initialSupply parameter accepts number type but if the fed value were out of the range \n\n### capped by number.MAX_SAFE_INTEGER, it might cause an unexpected result or error. In this case, it is \n\nrecommended to use the (^) BigNumber type, especially for a (^) uint256 sized numeric input value. \n\n### Return Value \n\nPromiEvent (^) : A promise combined event emitter, which is resolved with a new KIP7 instance. \n\n### Additionally, the following events can occur: \n\n### Name Type Description \n\n### transactionHash string \n\n### Fired right after the transaction is sent and a transaction hash is \n\n### available. \n\n### receipt object \n\n### Fired when the transaction receipt is available. If you want to know \n\n### about the properties inside the receipt object, see \n\n### getTransactionReceipt. Receipts from KIP7 instances have an 'events' \n\n### attribute parsed via abi instead of a 'logs' attribute. \n\n### error Error Fired if an error occurs during sending. \n\n### Example \n\n // using the promise > caver.kct.kip7.deploy({^ Make^ this^ page^ better \n\n\n## caver.kct.kip7.detectInterface \n\n name: Jasmine , symbol: 'JAS', decimals: 18 , initialSupply: ' 100000000000000000000 ', }, '0x{address in hex}').then(console.log) KIP7 { ... _address: '0x598367e443D8a2b644Fec69a2C12aF44BC283f23', _jsonInterface: [ ... { anonymous: false, inputs: [ { indexed: true, name: 'owner', type: 'address' }, { indexed: true, name: 'spender', type: 'address' }, { indexed: false, name: 'value', type: 'uint256' } ], name: 'Approval', type: 'event', signature: '0x8c5be...' } ] } \n\n // Send object as second parameter > caver.kct.kip7.deploy({ name: 'Jasmine', symbol: 'JAS', decimals: 18 , initialSupply: ' 100000000000000000000 ', }, { from: '0x{address in hex}', feeDelegation: true, feePayer: '0x{address in hex}', }).then(console.log) \n\n // using event emitter and promise > caver.kct.kip7.deploy({ name: 'Jasmine', symbol: 'JAS', decimals: 18 , initialSupply: ' 100000 ', }, '0x{address in hex}') .on('error', function( error ) { ... }) .on('transactionHash', function( transactionHash ) { ... }) .on('receipt', function( receipt ) { console.log(receipt.contractAddress) // contains the new token contract address }) .then(function( newKIP7Instance ) { console.log(newKIP7Instance.options.address) // instance with the new token contract }) \n\n Make this page better \n\n\n### Returns the information of the interface implemented by the token contract.

    " SDKs and Libraries caver-js API References caver.wallet caver.wallet.keyring \n\n# caver.wallet.keyring \n\n#### caver.wallet.keyring is a package that provides functionality related to Keyring which includes \n\n#### address and private key(s). \n\n## Class \n\nKeyring (^) is a structure that contains the address of the account and the private key(s). This is a class in \n\n#### caver-js that allows users to sign on using their own Kaia’s account. \n\n#### Keyring can be classified into three types depending on the type of key being stored:^ SingleKeyring^ to \n\n#### store one address and one private key, MultipleKeyring to store one address and multiple private keys, \n\n#### and RoleBasedKeyring to store one address and one or more private keys for each role. \n\n#### SingleKeyring: User signs with a private key \n\n#### MultipleKeyring: User signs with private keys \n\n#### RoleBasedKeyring: User signs with the private key(s) by role \n\n## SingleKeyring \n\n#### SingleKeyring is a class that stores the address of the account and a private key. To create a \n\n#### SingleKeyring instance with a private key string, please refer to caver.wallet.keyring.create. \n\n#### SingleKeyring uses a private key with which no roles assigned. \n\n#### properties \n\n#### Name Type Description \n\n#### address string The address of the account. \n\n#### key PrivateKey An instance of PrivateKey containing one private key inside. \n\n## MultipleKeyring \n\n const keyring = new caver.wallet.keyring.singleKeyring(address, key) \n\n(^) Make this page better \n\n\n#### MultipleKeyring is a class that stores the address of the account and the multiple private keys. \n\n#### To create a MultipleKeyring instance with private key strings, please refer to caver.wallet.keyring.create. \n\n#### MultipleKeyring uses private keys with which no roles assigned. \n\n#### properties \n\n#### Name Type Description \n\n#### address string The address of the account. \n\n#### keys Array An array of PrivateKey instances containing one private key inside. \n\n### RoleBasedKeyring \n\n#### RoleBasedKeyring is a class that stores the address of the account and the private keys to be \n\n#### used for each role in the form of an array. \n\n#### RoleBasedKeyring defines keys which is implemented as a two-dimensional array (empty keys looks \n\n#### like [ [], [], [] ] ) that can include multiple keys for each role. The first array element defines the \n\n#### private key(s) for roleTransactionKey , the second defines private key(s) for \n\n#### roleAccountUpdateKey , and the third defines the private key(s) for roleFeePayerKey. \n\n#### properties \n\n#### Name Type Description \n\n#### address string The address of the account. \n\n#### keys Array \n\n#### A two-dimensional array that defines the keys used for each role. Each role \n\n#### includes PrivateKey instance(s). The first element in this is \n\n#### roleTransactionKey. The second element is roleAccountUpdateKey. The \n\nlast element is (^) roleFeePayerKey. \n\n#### Below is a getter defined in keyring to intuitively use the key defined for each role. The key used for each \n\n#### role can be accessed more easily through the getter below. \n\n const keyring = new caver.wallet.keyring.multipleKeyring(address, keys) \n\n const keyring = new caver.wallet.keyring.roleBasedKeyring(address, keys) \n\n Make^ this^ page^ better \n\n\n#### Name Type Description \n\n#### roleTransactionKey Array \n\n#### The roleTransactionKey used to sign transactions (except for \n\n#### transactions for the account update). \n\n#### keyring.roleTransactionkey will return the first element of \n\n#### keys property. \n\n#### roleAccountUpdateKey Array \n\n#### The roleAccountUpdateKey used to sign account update \n\ntransactions. (^) keyring.roleAccountUpdateKey will return the \n\n#### second element of keys property. \n\n#### roleFeePayerKey Array \n\n#### The roleFeePayerKey used to sign transactions as a fee payer. \n\n#### keyring.roleFeePayerKey will return the thrid element of \n\n#### keys property. \n\n### PrivateKey \n\n#### PrivateKey is a class that contains a private key string. The private key to be used for each role in \n\nKeyring is defined as this (^) PrivateKey instance. \n\n#### properties \n\n#### Name Type Description \n\n#### privateKey string The private key string. \n\n### SignatureData \n\n#### SignatureData is a class that contains signature data inside.

    " SDKs and Libraries viem \n\n# viem \n\n#### Viem is a typescript interface for Ethereum that provides low-level primitives for interacting with \n\n#### Ethereum and other EVM-Compatible blockchain. With kaia supporting features for Ethereum \n\n#### Equivalence, Ethereum tools such as viem can be used on kaia without any significant modifications. \n\n#### For that reason, developers can leverage this compatibility and use the viem library to interact with a \n\n#### kaia node. \n\n#### In this guide, you’ll learn how to use the viem library to read data from the blockchain, send a \n\n#### transaction, and interact with an existing contract on the kaia Network. \n\n## Prerequisites \n\n#### Code-Editor: a source-code editor such as VS Code. \n\n#### Metamask: used to deploy the contracts, sign transactions and interact with the contracts. \n\n#### RPC Endpoint: you can get this from one of the supported Endpoint Providers. \n\n#### Test KAIA from Faucet: fund your account with sufficient KAIA. \n\n#### NodeJS and NPM \n\n#### TS-node: used for running TypeScript scripts. \n\n## Setup Project \n\n#### To get started, you need to create a project directory to house the files to be created in this guide. \n\n mkdir viem-example cd viem-example \n\n Make this page better \n\n\n### 1. Install viem \n\n#### To install viem run the following command in your terminal: \n\n#### In this tutorial, we will create a bunch of scripts file to read data from the blockchain, send transactions, \n\n#### and also interact with existing smart contract. To get started, you need to know how to set up viem for \n\n#### each of your script files. \n\n### 2. Set up Public Client & Transport \n\n#### Firstly, you need to set up your Public Client with a desired Transport & Chain. A Public Client is an \n\n#### interface to public JSON-RPC API methods such as retrieving block numbers, transactions, reading from \n\n#### smart contracts, etc through Public Actions. \n\n### 3. Set up Wallet Client and account \n\n#### Secondly, you need to set a wallet client to interact with an account. With wallet client, you can perform \n\n#### actions such as retrieving accounts, executing transactions, signing messages, etc through Wallet \n\n#### Actions. \n\n## Reading data from the blockchain \n\n npm i viem \n\n import { createPublicClient, http } from 'viem' import { klaytnBaobab } from 'viem/chains' \n\n const client = createPublicClient({ chain: klaytnBaobab, transport: http(\"https://public-en-kairos.node.kaia.io\"), }) \n\n import { createWalletClient } from 'viem' import { privateKeyToAccount } from 'viem/accounts' \n\n const walletClient = createWalletClient({ chain: klaytnBaobab, transport: http(\"https://public-en-kairos.node.kaia.io\") }) \n\n const account = privateKeyToAccount(\"PASTE PRIVATE KEY HERE\"); \n\n Make^ this^ page^ better \n\n\nTo read data from the blockchain, create a new (^) read.ts file in your project folder by running this \n\n#### command: \n\n#### After creating this file, set up your public client as done in the set up section above. In this section, you \n\n#### will learn how to read data from the blockchain (e.g., blockNumber, KAIA balance). \n\n#### To see this in action, paste the following code in your read.ts. \n\n#### Output \n\n#### To run the script and read data from the blockchain, paste the following command in your terminal: \n\n#### If the transaction was successful, you’ll see the block number and user’s KAIA balance in your terminal. \n\n touch read.ts \n\n import { createPublicClient, http, formatEther } from 'viem' import { klaytnBaobab } from 'viem/chains' \n\n const client = createPublicClient({ chain: klaytnBaobab, transport: http(\"https://public-en-kairos.node.kaia.io\"), }) \n\n async function getBlockNumber() { const blockNumber = await client.getBlockNumber() console.log(Current block number is: ${blockNumber}); } \n\n async function getKlayBalance() { const balance = await client.getBalance({ address: '0x75Bc50a5664657c869Edc0E058d192EeEfD570eb', }) const formatBal = formatEther(balance); console.log(Current KAIA balance is ${formatBal}); } \n\n getBlockNumber(); getKlayBalance(); \n\n npx ts-node read.ts \n\n Make this page better \n\n\n## Sending a transaction to the blockchain \n\nTo send a transaction to the blockchain, create a new (^) send.ts file in your project folder by running this \n\n#### command: \n\n#### After creating this file, set up your wallet client as done in the set up section above. In this section, you \n\n#### will learn how to send a transaction to the blockchain (for example, send KAIA to an address). \n\n#### To see this in action, paste the following code in your send.ts. \n\n#### Output \n\n#### To run the script and send transaction to the blockchain, paste the following command in your terminal: \n\n#### If the transaction was successful, you’ll see the transaction hash logged in your terminal. \n\n touch send.ts \n\n import { createWalletClient, http, parseEther } from 'viem' import { klaytnBaobab } from 'viem/chains' import { privateKeyToAccount } from 'viem/accounts' \n\n const walletClient = createWalletClient({ chain: klaytnBaobab, transport: http(\"https://public-en-kairos.node.kaia.io\") }) \n\n const account = privateKeyToAccount(\"PASTE PRIVATE KEY\"); \n\n async function sendKlayToRecipient() { const hash = await walletClient.sendTransaction({ account, to: \"PASTE RECIPIENT ADDRESS\", value: parseEther('0.01') }) \n\n console.log(Send KAIA tx hash is: ${hash}); } \n\n sendKlayToRecipient(); \n\n npx ts-node send.ts \n\n Make this page better \n\n\n## Interacting with smart contracts \n\nTo interact with an existing smart contract on kaia, create a new (^) interact.ts file in your project folder \n\n#### by running this command: \n\n#### After creating this file, set up your public and wallet client as done in the set up section above. In this \n\n#### section, you will use viem to both: \n\n#### Read from the contract; and \n\n#### Write to a contract. \n\n#### For the purpose of this guide, a simple_storage contract was compiled and deployed on Remix IDE. For \n\n#### that reason, we will read from this contract by calling the retrieve^ function, and also send a \n\n#### transaction to this contract by calling the store function. \n\n### 1. Read from contract \n\n#### To read from the contract, we used readContract method which Internally uses a Public Client to call \n\n#### the call action with ABI-encoded data.
