    "smart contracts don't write themselves, but kaia’s developer tools make it feel like they almost do.",
    "the blockchain trilemma isn't solved by hype. it's solved by innovation. kaia blockchain is proof of that.",
    "people keep asking 'when adoption?' but no one asks 'when better dev tooling?' kaia blockchain’s SDKs are the answer.",
