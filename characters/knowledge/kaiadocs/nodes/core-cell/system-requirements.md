## H/W Specification <a id="h-w-specification"></a>

The network performance is measured based on the worst hardware specification within the network. According to the blockchain network structure, it is only possible to be scaled up vertically \(increasing hardware capacity\). Hence, it is recommended that all the nodes within the network should have the best hardwares having the similar specifications with each other at least.

If you're curious about the rationale of this hardware spec, the medium article [Determining optimal hardware specs for Kaia node operators](https://klaytn.foundation/node-operator-optimal-specs/) would help you understand.

The following sections show the recommended specifications for both CNs and PNs.

### Bare-metal Server <a id="bare-metal-server"></a>

| Category | Specification |
| :--- | :--- |
| Server | Intel® Server System [M50CYP1UR212](https://www.intel.sg/content/www/xa/en/products/sku/214842/intel-server-system-m50cyp1ur212/specifications.html) |
| CPU | Intel® Xeon 8358 2.60 GHz \(32-core/64-thread\) |
| Memory | 128GB \(32GB \* 4\) |
| Storage | 4TB (or larger size) SSD (The preferred storage size and configuration could differ depending on the chain data size. Please consult the Kaia Team for more information.) |

Note that this is a recommended hardware specification for CNs and PNs, not an exact requirement. Any physical machine with similar hardware configurations would be sufficient to operate a CN or a PN.

You can use and apply a live-pruning option to use live-pruning DB. For more details, please refer https://docs.kaia.io/learn/storage/live-pruning/. However, note that live-pruning spec is not recommended for CNs but this may change in the future.

### Cloud VM <a id="cloud-vm"></a>

#### Recommended Specification for AWS<a id="recommended-specification-for-aws"></a>

| Node Type | Model | vCPU | Memory \(GiB\) | Storage size \(GiB\) | Storage speed \(IOPS\) | Price \(Seoul region, USD/h\) |
| :---: | :---: | :---: | :---: | :---: | :---: | :---: |
| CN | m6i.8xlarge  | 32 | 128 | 4,000 (Minimum) | 9,000 | 1.888 |
| PN | m6i.4xlarge  | 16 | 64 | 4,000 (Minimum) | 9,000 | 0.944 |
| PN (with Live Pruning DB) | m6i.2xlarge  | 8 | 32 | 3,500 (Minimum) | 9,000 | 0.472 |


This storage specification is derived from AWS EBS SSD (gp3) specification.

## Storage Requirements <a id="storage-requirements"></a>

Assuming 100 TPS in average, 300 bytes average transaction size, and 1-second block latency, the expected daily storage requirement is about 2.5 GB/day \(=300x100x86400\).

## Operating System <a id="operating-system"></a>

Recommended environment is compatible with RHEL (7.8 or later).
Kaia binaries are fully tested on Amazon Linux 2, but they should work on other linux-based environments as well. macOS binaries are also provided for development purpose.
