# [KAIA GOVERNANCE](https://www.kaia.io/governance)

Optimized. Practical. Effective.
================================

Kaia’s governance structure is designed to deliver the best of all worlds - expert leadership, ecosystem growth, and all the practical benefits of decentralization with none of the drawbacks.
-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

### A council of proven luminaries

Kaia is led by the Governance Council (GC), a group of global leaders in the Web3 space and beyond that contribute their experience and expertise towards all governance decisions.

### Collaboration that goes beyond validation

Beyond node operation and governance, Kaia GC members actively accelerate Kaia’s ecosystem growth through their DApps, services, initiatives, and business networks.

### Practical, optimized decentralization

Public delegation and the geographical distribution of Kaia GC members ensure that no single entity can jeopardize the security or the open and public nature of the Kaia network - without the need for thousands of nodes.
